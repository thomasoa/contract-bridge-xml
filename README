FILE NOTES

  Top Level XSL Files

  There is no bridge logic in these files, which are all about
  processing articles, either one at a time, or as a "book."

    article.xsl  - file for handling a single article
    articles.xsl - file for handling article sets;
                   create a framed view of the articles,
                   with "Next" and "Prev" links and a table
                   of contents

    shared.xsl        - Common includes, used by the above


  XSL Library Files: Bridge Tags

    auction.xsl       - code for handling auctions
    diagram.xsl       - code for handling hand diagrams
    hands.xsl         - code for handling hands
    inline.xsl        - code for handling inlines and
                        other "small" sections


  XSL Library Files: Other Tags

    link.xsl          - code to handle <link> tag
    default.xsl       - code for handling unhandled tags
    test.xsl          - code for the test pages 

  Cascading Style Sheet

    html/article.css - style sheet used by the generated
                        HTML.  Modifying this can change
                        the look of the articles without
                        regenerating them.

  XML Inputs

    xml/everybody.xml     - An independent bridge article
    xml/test/table.xml    - A description of the test articles 
    xml/test/deal.xml     - A source of diagrams for external
                            references, used in xml/test/diagram.xml
    xml/test/*.xml        - Other .xml files in xml/test are
                            articles.
    
    xml/badfit
    xml/hands
    xml/parzero
    xml/tenaces           - Other article collections

  Translation File

    translations.xml  - A set of "constants," some of which
                         can be customized.

NAMESPACES

  I've used a couple of personal namespaces here:

     xmlns:bridge="http://www.thomasoandrews.com/xmlns/bridge"

           Used inside the XML articles.

     xmlns:translation="http://www.thomasoandrews.com/xmlns/bridge/trans"

           Used in translation.xml.

     xmlns:check="http://www.thomasoandrews.com/xmlns/checklink"

           Used for testing links (see xml/test/checklink.xml )

     xmlns:redirect="org.apache.xalan.lib.Redirect"

           Namespace for Xalan's redirect feature.  Used in
           articles.xsl .

     xmlns:xalan="http://xml.apache.org/xalan"

           Namespace for Xalan's extension functions - used to
           call xalan:nodeset().  Used in auctions.xsl, for 
           handling auctions.  Will also be required for card play,
           when I implement that.

    xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"

           The standard XSL namespace.

  These namespaces are not meant to be permanent.  Also, namespace
  URNs are not meant to be followed - they are just unique 
  identifiers.

  A public BridgeML standard would probably use a URN with a
  reference to the WBF.

DTDS AND/OR SCHEMAS

  I have done no work on these, yet.  My firm belief is that
  you define these things only after you know what you want
  the XML to look like.
