We've all seen contracts which can make more tricks declared from one
side than the other.  A typical example is:
<diagram>
<hand seat="N" sp="AK" he="KQT9" di="AKT98" cl="98"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="JT98" he="876" di="765" cl="AQ7"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="7654" he="J5" di="43" cl="JT654"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="Q32" he="A432" di="QJ2" cl="K32"/>
<!--
             S: AK
             H: KQT9
             D: AKT98
             C: 98

S: JT98                       S: 7654
H: 876                        H: J5
D: 765                        D: 43
C: AQ7                        C: JT654

             S: Q32
             H: A432
             D: QJ2
             C: K32
-->
</diagram>
</p>
<p>
If North declares <contract code="6N"/> or <contract code="6H"/>, East can set
it with a club lead.  But when declared by South, both slam makes, scoring 
five diamonds, four hearts, and three spades.
</p>
<p>
The <holding cards="C:K32"/> holding is an <em>asymmetric guard</em> - a
holding which can only be profitable attacked from one side.
</p><p>
This idea led me to ask the question, "Are there deals which play
better by North in, say, hearts, but better by South in notrump?"
</p>
<p>Here is just such a deal:
<diagram id="first">
<hand seat="N" sp="Q4" he="AKQJ92" di="4" cl="A865"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="86" he="743" di="K3" cl="QJT973"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="JT95" he="T65" di="Q98652" cl=""/>
<hand seat="S" sp="AK732" he="8" di="AJT7" cl="K42"/>
<!--
             S: Q4
             H: AKQJ92
             D: 4
             C: A865

S: 86                         S: JT95
H: 743                        H: T65
D: K3                         D: Q98652
C: QJT973                     C: -

             S: AK732
             H: 8
             D: AJT7
             C: K42
-->
</diagram>
</p><p>
In choosing between grand slams, obviously South cannot declare
the heart contract - West could give his partner a ruff immediately.
</p><p>
On the other hand, North can easily make <contract code="7H"/>,
by drawing trumps then setting up the spades with one ruff.
</p><p>
What about the <contract code="7N"/> contract?  On a non-diamond lead, 
<contract code="7N"/> can be made.  Declarer simply cashes his top
black cards then runs his hearts, getting to this position:
<diagram original="first">
<hand seat="N" sp="" he="^2" di="4" cl="6"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="" he="" di="K3" cl="Q"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="J" he="" di="Q9" cl=""/>
<hand seat="S" sp="7" he="" di="AJ" cl=""/>
<!--
             S: -
             H: *2*
             D: 4
             C: 6

S: -                          S: J
H:  -                         H:  - 
D: K3                         D: Q9
C: Q                          C:  - 

             S: 7
             H:  - 
             D: AJ
             C:  - 
-->
</diagram>
This is the standard double-squeeze position.  On the last heart, East
must keep his spade, and therefore must pitch a diamond.  South's spade
is then pitched, and West must give up in clubs or diamonds.
</p><p>
But what of a diamond lead?  When led by East, the diamond lead does,
indeed, ruin declarer's chances. When led by West, declarer's double
squeeze vanished, but is replaced by a simple squeeze.
</p><p>
Why is that?  Because the lead from the West hand requires one of East
or West to commit a diamond honor to the first trick.  This leaves only
one defender guarding the suit.
</p><p>For example, if West leads the <diamond card="K"/>, South wins
in hand, cashes his two top club tricks, and runs his hearts to this
position: 
<diagram original="first">
<hand seat="N" sp="Q2" he="^2" di="" cl="86"/>
<hand seat="W" sp="86" he="" di="3" cl="QJ"/>
<hand seat="E" sp="JT95" he="" di="Q" cl=""/>
<hand seat="S" sp="AK72" he="" di="J" cl=""/>
<!--
             S: Q4
             H: *2*
             D:  - 
             C: 86

S: 86                         S: JT95
H:  -                         H:  - 
D: 3                          D: Q
C: QJ                         C:  - 

             S: AK72
             H:  - 
             D: J
             C:  - 
-->
</diagram>
On this last heart, East is squeezed in spades and diamonds.
</p><p>If West instead opened with a low diamond, East would
have to contribute the <diamond card="Q"/>, and West would be
squeezed at the end in diamonds and clubs.
</p><p>
This first example of an Asymmetric Deal employs a cop-out - 
East's void is what makes the <contract code="7H"/> contract fail.
Declarer's club holding can hardly be called an asymmetric guard.  The
rest of the examples will show more subtle types of positions.  Most
of these hands require careful study for each of the four (sometimes
six!) possible contracts under discussion.  In these deals, both
declarer and the defenders often have to walk a very thin line to
maximize their results.
</p><p>
Fundamentally, these are double-dummy problems, so I will not try to
construct auctions, or explain what might lead a declarer to take
one line over another.  I am not so accomplished a bridge writer
that I can create such fictions and not make them seem forced.
It is unlikely that many of the lines described herein would be
found at the table.
</p>
<h2>Finding Deals</h2>
<p>
Doubly asymmetric deals are rare, and require an eagle eye.  Thankfully,
I can employ a computer's eagle eye.  I have employed two computer
programs:
<ul>
<li> <link rel='onsite' href="/deal/">Deal</link>,
my own flexible dealer.</li>
<li>
<link href="http://www.gibware.com/">GIB</link>,
a double dummy solver written by Matt Ginsberg.</li>
<li>More recently, I've been using the newest version of Deal which includes a builtin double-dummy solver.</li>
</ul>
I've written an interface between Deal and GIB which allows me to find
deals with interesting double-dummy properties.
</p><p>
Once the deals were found, I sifted through them myself, and extracted
what I thought were the most interesting examples.  I hope you enjoy
them.
