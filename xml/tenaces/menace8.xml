North/South can make <contract code="3N"/> from either side,  but the
two minor suit games are more interesting.
</p>
<h2>Diamonds</h2>
<p>
We'll start with the easiest denomination first.</p>
<p>Obviously, a club lead by East will set <contract code="5D"/>
declared by  North, leading to an immediate ruff.  If declared by
South, West can give his partner a ruff, but at the expense of the
second natural club trick.
</p>
<h2>Clubs</h2>
<p>
The risk to declaring <contract code="5C"/> is that the defense will
force declarer to ruff two hearts, setting up a third trump trick for
the defense. 
</p><p>
But if East is on lead, that threat doesn't materialize.  Suppose East
leads a low heart.  West is forced to contribute the queen, and declarer
wins the ace and immediately attacks clubs.  West wins, and continues
hearts, but declarer can play the <heart card="8"/> from dummy, and
East's king is forced.  When West gets in with the second club, the
<heart card="T"/> is high in North's hand.
</p><p>
If declared by South, however, West can profitably lead hearts.
South must fly the <heart card="A"/>, with East and West allowed to
keep the <heart cards="KQ"/>.  Each time declarer loses a trump to
West, West can lead a heart, setting up West's own long club trick.
