<diagram id="start">
<hand seat="N" sp="J2" he="AK97" di="AQJ4" cl="J96"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="64" he="T653" di="KT975" cl="AQ"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="A93" he="QJ42" di="82" cl="8753"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="KQT875" he="8" di="63" cl="KT42"/>
</diagram>
<p>
In this example of double asymmetry, North/South might consider game in
either spades or notrump.
</p>
<h2>Spades</h2>
<p>
If South declares the <contract code="4S"/> contract, all is well - 
the opponents will get their three black winners and no more.
</p><p>
If North declares <contract code="4S"/>, though, the club lead sets it,
because the defense gets two clubs, the trump ace, and a club ruff.
</p>
<h2>Notrump</h2>
<p>
South cannot make <contract code="3N"/> on a heart lead
from West.  Twist and turn as he might, he cannot avoid losing two
hearts, two clubs, and a spade before he can run his nine apparent
tricks.
</p><p>
On the other hand, if North declares in <contract code="3N"/>, he cannot be set
by a heart or any other lead.
</p><p>
On a low heart lead, North wins West's <heart card="T"/> with the ace, and
leads the <spade card="J"/>. East has to duck this, to keep declarer
from running five spades when he gets in next.  North continues with a
spade and East can safely win this trick, leading to this position:
<diagram source="start">
<hand seat="N" sp="" he="K97" di="AQJ4" cl="J96"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="" he="653" di="KT975" cl="AQ"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="9" he="QJ4" di="82" cl="8753"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="KQT8" he="" di="63" cl="KT42"/>
</diagram>
</p>
<p>
East cannot attack hearts himself here, because that would give declarer
a third stopper. So he has to lead a club to West's queen.
</p>
<p> West continues with a heart, ducked to East, and East again cannot lead 
hearts, holding <holding cards="H:Q4"/> and North holding <holding cards="H:K7"/>.  West gets in one more time
to lead hearts, but North still has the <heart card="K"/>, and the defense
fails to collect its five tricks before declarer makes his nine.
