In notrump south makes 8, north makes 9
In spades south makes 10, north makes 9
In hearts south makes 7, north makes 7
In diamonds south makes 7, north makes 7
In clubs south makes 7, north makes 7
NOTE: In notrump, diamond leads from west score four diamonds and a heart
      In spades, strip and endplay in hearts is the risk for west, and
      a heart opening lead from east breaks it up

<h2>Notrump</h2>
<p>Only North can make <contract code="3N"/>.  If South declares notrump, then west can start with the <card:DJ/>, and the defense starts with
three diamonds, then a heart to the ace, and a fourth diamond.</p>
<p>But if East is on lead, the diamond suit is blocked.  The defense can take three diamonds off the top, but then North's <card:DQ/> is good.</p>
<h2>Spades</h2>
<p>The trick here is to avoid letting East lead hearts twice.  If North is declarer in spades, then East can lead hearts, and then again when he gets on lead with the <card:DK/>.</p>
<p>But if South is declarer, she can keep East from winning
two diamonds by playing the <card:DQ/> if West leads the
<card:D8/>, and plays small diamonds otherwise.  The suit
is safely blocked.  When East gets in with the diamond queen and
leads a heart, south plays the <card:HK/>, and West must win
the ace.</p>
<p>Declarer can easily achieve this end position:</p>

<p>On the last spade, West is squeezed in the red suits.</p>
