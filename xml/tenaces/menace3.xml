<title>A Three-way Example</title>

<diagram id="start">
<hand seat="N" sp="A98752" he="AQ" di="K" cl="QJT5"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="QT4" he="J765" di="T73" cl="K72"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="63" he="KT82" di="J54" cl="9643"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="KJ" he="943" di="AQ9862" cl="A6"/>
</diagram>
<p>
There are actually three strains possible on this hand - notrump,
spades, and diamonds - and North/South can make slam from only one side
in each strain.</p>
<h2>Notrump</h2>
<p>
After a heart lead by West, <contract code="6N"/> cannot make.  There are 
10 top tricks, and declarer will need to set up two more to make his
slam, but he needs to lose the lead to West in spades or clubs to do
this, at which point the defense can take a couple more heart tricks.
</p><p>
Declarer can run a strip squeeze against West to get an 11th trick, if
<contract code="5NT"/> is the contract. Declarer loses the heart finesse and
wins the heart return.  He then cashes the <diamond card="K"/>,
crosses to the <spade card="K"/> and runs the diamonds:
<diagram original="start">
<hand seat="N" sp="A98" he="" di="" cl="QJ"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="QT" he="5" di="" cl="K7"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="6" he="T8" di="" cl="96"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="J" he="9" di="^2" cl="A6"/>
</diagram>
On the last diamond, West can't part with a spade or a club, so must
part with a heart.  Declarer then can play the <spade card="A"/>
and a low spade, forcing West to lead clubs.
</p><p>
So the most South can make in notrump is 11 tricks.
</p><p>
Declared by North, though, <contract code="6N"/> plays itself.
Declarer can set up the two extra tricks he needs in either clubs or
spades.
</p>
<h2>Spades</h2>
<p>
Declared by North, <contract code="6S"/> stumbles when declared by
North, after a club lead. The club lead breaks declarer's
communication to the long diamonds. 
</p><p>
When declared by South, <contract code="6S"/> rolls home on any lead.
For example, on a heart lead, declarer wins the ace, cashes the
<diamond card="K"/>, cashes the <spade cards="AK"/>, then starts running
diamonds, pitching the <heart card="Q"/> then clubs, lead to:
<diagram original="start">
<hand seat="N" sp="9875" he="" di="" cl="QJT"/>
<hand seat="W" sp="Q" he="5" di="" cl="K7"/>
<hand seat="E" sp="6" he="T8" di="" cl="96"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="J" he="9" di="^2" cl="A6"/>
</diagram>
No matter when West ruffs in, South can get back to his hand with the
<club card="A"/> to finish running the diamonds.
</p><p>
If West tries to cut off the entries with a <club card="K"/> lead,
that sets up too many tricks in the dummy - only the heart loser needs
to be pitched.</p>
<h2> Diamonds </h2>
<p>
When South declares <contract code="6D"/>, West can lead a heart.
This breaks off the entry to the long spades, forcing South to
apparently lose three tricks.  But that is an illusion - South can run
the same strip squeeze against West which allowed him to make 11
tricks in notrump. 
</p><p>
But when North declares <contract code="6D"/>, East cannot profit from
leading a heart.  Perhaps the club lead?
</p><p>
North wins the <club card="A"/>, crosses to the <diamond card="K"/>, and
back to dummy with the <spade card="K"/>.  North finishes drawing the trumps,
crosses to the <spade card="A"/>, and ruffs a spade.  Declarer still has
the <heart card="A"/>, and comes to thirteen tricks.  A two-trick asymmetry!
</p>
<h2>Post-mortem</h2>
<p>
This one is a relative rarity - two suit contracts play better
from opposite sides.  Usually, one side plays better in the
suit contract(s) and the other side side plays better in the
notrump contract.</p>
