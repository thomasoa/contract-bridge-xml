<p>This deal comes from a Hungarian Teams Semifinal, and was submitted by
Gal Hegedus. When played in the match, the two contracts were <contract code='3N'/> by North, and <contract code='4S'/> by South, which we'll see are
the exact best sides for these two games.</p>
<h2>Spades</h2>
<p>If South declares <contract code="4S"/>, he can make by unblocking the
<card code="DA"/> and using the <card code="S9"/> as an entry to pitch
either a club or heart loser.</p>
<p>If North declares, however, East can lead a spade to kill North's entry
before the diamonds are unblocked, and declarer must lose two hearts, a
spade, and a club.</p>
<h2>Notrump</h2>
<p>If South declares <contract code="3N"/>, a lead of the <card code="CT"/> sets it.  Declarer cannot avoid losing four clubs and a spade.</p>
<p>But if North declares, the defense run into a blockage problem in clubs.  East must lead one of his high clubs, which declarer can safely win with the ace,
leaving the club jack in his hand.  Then when West wins the <card code="SK"/>, the club suit is blocked:</p>

<hand seat="W" sp='5' he='J8' di='Q986' cl='T97'/>
<hand seat="N" sp='9' he='T9542' di='KJ4' cl='J'/>
<hand seat="E" sp='7' he='KQ3' di='T7' cl='K543'/>
</diagram>
<h2>The Real Play</h2>
<p>Against <contract code="3N"/>, the real East chose to underlead his
clubs, which turned out bad for him, and declarer was able to actually take
eleven tricks when, after unblocking his diamonds,  east won the first spade and failed to kill the heart entry to South's hand.</p>
<p><contract code="4S"/> made easily.</p>
