<h2>Hearts</h2>
<p>South makes <contract code="4H"/>.</p>
<h2>Diamonds</h2>
<p>If South declares <contract code="5D"/>, West leads a spade.  If
North plays the <card:SQ/>, East wins the ace and exits a
spade.  Declarer still has to lose the <card:DA/>, so he can't afford
to play the clubs or hearts from her hand, so she must attack diamonds.  West wins the first diamond, and returns a diamond, reaching this position:</p>
<diagram>
<hand seat="E" sp='T76' di='T' he='K87' cl='T5'/>
<hand seat="N" sp='' di='Q975' he='43' cl='862'/>
<hand seat="S" sp='' di='' he='AQJ92' cl='AKQJ'/>
<hand seat="W" sp='J8' di='' he='T65' cl='9743'/>
</diagram>
<p>South is stuck in his hand, and East must score another trick.</p>
<p>If North is declaring, East can't lead spades and keep North from winning
the <card:SQ/> to take the heart finesse. So say East leads a diamond to West's ace, and West continues a diamond.</p>
<p>South plays two rounds of clubs followed by the <card:SK/>. East must duck to avoid giving North an entry.  Then South plays a low spade to the queen, and East wins his ace, leading to:</p>
<diagram>
<hand seat="E" sp='T76' di='T' he='K87' cl=''/>
<hand seat="N" sp='' di='Q975' he='43' cl='8'/>
<hand seat="S" sp='' di='' he='AQJ92' cl='AK'/>
<hand seat="W" sp='J8' di='' he='T65' cl='97'/>
</diagram>
<p>With East on lead, he must yield an entry to the North, or let South finesse hearts, take the heart ace, and ruff a heart to draw trumps and claim.  Either way, declare ends up with 11 tricks.</p>
