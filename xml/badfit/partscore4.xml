<hand seat="N" sp="J97" he="AT8" di="T63" cl="KJ96"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="AT654" he="K5" di="KJ7" cl="752"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="K32" he="QJ643" di="43" cl="Q83"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="Q8" he="972" di="AQ985" cl="AT4"/>
</diagram>
<p>
In this example, theoretical par is <contract code="1S"/>, making, by
South.
</p>
<p>
If East/West play <contract code="1S"/>, the defense starts with the <card:HA/>,
followed by a club to the ten, finessing East's queen, then the 
<card:DA/>, <card:CA/>, <card:CK/> and a fourth club
at this position:
<diagram>
<hand seat="N" sp="J97" he="T8" di="T6" cl="^J"/>
<hand seat="W" sp="AT654" he="K" di="KJ" cl=""/>
<hand seat="E" sp="K32" he="QJ64" di="4" cl=""/>
<hand seat="S" sp="Q8" he="97" di="Q985" cl=""/>
</diagram>
North/South have taken three clubs and two red aces.  They have a natural
trump trick, and this fourth club promotes a second trump trick. 
</p>
<p>
If South plays <contract code="1S"/>, then, the defense must play two rounds
of trumps before letting declarer in, or else declarer can again set up
a seventh trick. [If they play only one round, South still has the trump
queen, and therefore can still execute the trump promotion above.] 
</p><p>
Say they start with the <spade cards="AK"/>, then East plays a diamond.
South finesses the queen, and West wins the <card:DK/> leading
to this position:
<diagram>
<hand seat="N" sp="J" he="AT8" di="T6" cl="KJ96"/>
<hand seat="W" sp="T65" he="K5" di="J7" cl="752"/>
<hand seat="E" sp="3" he="QJ643" di="3" cl="Q83"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="" he="972" di="A985" cl="AT4"/>
</diagram>
West gives the declarer an extra diamond trick if he continues the suit.
If West exits a black suit, declarer takes his remaining trump and three
clubs, then plays a low heart from hand at this position.  
<diagram>
<hand seat="N" sp="" he="AT8" di="T6" cl="J"/>
<hand seat="W" sp="T6" he="K5" di="J7" cl=""/>
<hand seat="E" sp="" he="QJ643" di="3" cl=""/>
<hand seat="S" sp="" he="97^2" di="A98" cl=""/>
</diagram>
Declarer ducks if West plays the <card:HK/>, and West can
safely exit his low heart or a trump. 
</p>
<p>Dummy wins the <card:HA/>
and leads the last club, and we get to our favorite position:
<diagram>
<hand seat="N" sp="" he="T" di="T6" cl="^J"/>
<hand seat="W" sp="T6" he="" di="J7" cl=""/>
<hand seat="E" sp="" he="QJ6" di="3" cl=""/>
<hand seat="S" sp="" he="^9" di="A98" cl=""/>
</diagram>
West can either ruff this and be forced to lead a diamond, or let
it win and give declarer his seventh trick.
</p>
<p>
So, when in with the <card:DK/>, West has to lead a heart.  If he
leads a low heart, declarer wins the ace and immediately exits a heart,
which West must win with the king.
</p>
<p>
Basically, the trick to this hand is that West can be stripped without
allowing East in a second time to lead diamonds again.
