Every week, the oddest things happen at the bridge table.  This collection
is devoted to exploring a specific sort of oddity - the six-card fit.
Specifically, it will discuss the cases when the six-card fit is the
best place to play, double-dummy.
</p><p>
For example, in this grand slam:
<diagram>
<hand seat="N" sp="KJ5" he="" di="AKJ983" cl="AKJT"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="T76" he="Q854" di="62" cl="9842"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="8432" he="KT9" di="Q75" cl="765"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="AQ9" he="AJ7632" di="T4" cl="Q3"/>
<!--
             S: KJ5
             H: -
             D: AKJ983
             C: AKJT

S: T76                     S: 8432         
H: Q854                    H: KT9          
D: 62                      D: Q75          
C: 9842                    C: 765          

             S: AQ9
             H: AJ7632
             D: T4
             C: Q3
-->
</diagram>

<p>
North/South have a lot of playing strength, but the only grand slam
which makes is in clubs.  On a club lead, North wins, cashes
the <diamond cards="AK"/>, ruffs a diamond with the
<club card="Q"/>, re-enters North's hand in spades 
to draw trumps and claim.
</p><p>
Most of the examples that follow are significantly more complicated than
this, of course.

<h2>Finding Deals</h2>
<p>
As with my collection of <link rel='onsite' href="/deals/tenaces/">Double
Asymmetries,</link> this collection used a combination of two programs
to find interesting examples:
<ul>
<li> <link rel='onsite' href="/deal/">Deal</link>,
my own flexible dealer.</li>
<li>
<link rel='external' href="http://www.gibware.com/">GIB</link>,
a double dummy solver written by Matt Ginsberg.</li>
<li>More recently (as of May, 2008,) I've added Bo Haglund's double dummy solver to Deal, so I no longer need the GIB double dummy solver.</li>
</ul>
Actually, I didn't use GIB directly; instead, I used Ginsberg's library of
about 720,000 deals, including double dummy results. Ginsberg generated 
those results using GIB, however.
</p><p>
Six-card fits are the double-dummy par result about once out of every
210 deals - they are not that rare.
</p><p>
As with the previous collection, I did a considerable amount of
sifting by hand, finding the more interesting examples, altering holdings
to make the examples cleaner.
</p><p>
Thanks to Richard Pavlicek for pointing out some oversights on my
part.  Richard has a <link rel='external' href="http://www.rpbridge.net/7f05.htm">deal
on his site</link> where the only making game is in an awful 5-card suit.
</p><p>
As usual, I encourage feedback, particularly if you find errors in
analysis, but even if I've left in typos or bad grammar.  I'm a bad
copy editor :-)
