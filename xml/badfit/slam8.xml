<p>North/South cannot make <contract code="6N"/> on a diamond lead, because they only have 8 top tricks.</p>
<p>A <contract code="6H"/> contract is doomed if the defense takes its club ace and eventual heart trick.</p>
<p><contract code="6S"/> does not make on a diamond lead because North can set up his clubs, but cannot draw trumps
and preserve an entry to run them.</p>
<p>The only slam to make here is <contract code="6C"/>.</p>
<p>If the defense leads a diamond, it seems like they still prevail.  North solves the problem, however, by ruffing one diamond with the club king,
which strips East of his last diamond and unblocks the club suit.</p>
<p>Declarer crosses to North with a spade and leads top clubs until East takes his ace, leading to this:</p>

<hand seat="S" sp="AQ74" he="AKT7" di="" cl=""/>
</diagram>
<p>Whatever East leads here, North has the spade king entry to draw the rest of the trumps and then run the major winners.</p>
