I'll leave it to the reader to determine why <contract code="6H"/>,
<contract code="6S"/>, and <contract code="6N"/> fail.
</p><p>
It's rather surprising that <contract code="6D"/> makes on this deal,
if declared by South.  West should lead a heart or club, won in the
North hand. Declarer plays <diamond card="K"/> and <diamond
card="J"/>, and, whether West covers or not, is left with a tenace
over West in the trump suit.  Declarer then takes dummy's club and heart
winners, and crosses with a small heart to hand:

On a low heart from the South hand, West cannot profit
from ruffing, so West pitches a spade.  Declarer ruffs and plays the
diamond ace, pitching a spade.  Finally, declarer leads a club off dummy,
and West is caught:

<hand seat="N" sp="T932" he="" di="" cl="^3"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="KJ86" he="" di="Q" cl=""/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="4" he="J" di="" cl="J9^8"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="AQ" he="Q7" di="" cl="^Q"/>
</diagram>

             S: T932
             H:  - 
             D:  - 
             C: *3*

S: KJ86                    S: 4
H:  -                      H: J
D: Q                       D:  - 
C:  -                      C: J9*8*

             S: AQ
             H: Q7
             D:  - 
             C: *Q*
-->
This is essentially the end position we've seen twice before.
If West ruffs, he is forced to lead from the spades.  If he pitches,
declarer just runs his hearts, and West is still forced to pitch spades.
In the end, all West scores is his one trump trick.
