Can North/South make <contract code="6N"/>?  No, the timing is all
wrong - the defense must get a heart and either a diamond or a second
heart. 
</p><p>
Obviously, <contract code="6D"/> is not going to work, losing the
<heart card="A"/> and a trump. 
</p><p>
Does <contract code="6S"/> make?  Not if, as is likely, it is declared by North - a diamond
lead kills it.  But what if it is, improbably, declared by South?
</p><p>
Indeed, <contract code="6S"/> by South does indeed make - all declarer needs is a single heart ruff
and then he can pitch North's diamond losers on two long hearts and a club.
