<p>This is an unusual example - it is not surprising that East/West can make seven tricks in spades, but it is surprising that South can  make <contract code="3N"/>.
</p><p>
The void in spades means the
defense cannot take its six tricks.  South starts with seven tricks plus an easy trick to set up in diamonds. A heart lead gives up a ninth trick.
If West leads a club, South wins in hand, and immediately leads a diamond. If West flies the ace, declarer wins the continuation, cashes the diamond king and clubs, leading to this position:

West was forced to pitch a diamond to protect the heart suit.  Now
declarer exits a diamond, and West gets three tricks in the suit,
but then must concede the last two heart tricks.
<p>
If West had ducked the diamond lead, a substantially similar position
results, only with one more diamond in North, South, and West.
<p>
Of course, if East is declarer in 4S, he has an easy -500, with seven
top tricks.
