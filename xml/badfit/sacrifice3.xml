North can make a grand slam in clubs.  Say East leads a safe heart.
North wins the heart lead, cashes the top diamonds, and ruffs a diamond high.
North crosses with the <club card="J"/>, and ruffs another diamond high.
North then cashes the two hearts hearts, pitching spades from his hand.
Finally, North crosses with the club ace and draws East's trumps.
</p><p>
If East leads a club instead, then North uses the heart entry
to get back after the first diamond ruff.
</p><p>
Does the defense have a sacrifice?
</p><p>
A <contract code="7H"/> sacrifice does not succeed - the defense takes three top hearts immediately
then attacks clubs.  That kills the West hand, forcing him to ruff, and
never gets his spade tricks.  East/West can score three trumps and a diamond,
but that's it.
</p><p>
But <contract code="7S"/> is a fine sacrifice, always insured of five trump tricks, for -2000.
