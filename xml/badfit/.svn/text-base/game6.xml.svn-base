<p>
This is one of the most perverse examples.  <contract code="5C"/>
and <contract code="5D"/> fail due to two spade losers and a diamond loser.
<contract code="3N"/> goes down after
two heart leads, which must be ducked, then a shift to spades.
</p><p>
But <contract code="4S"/> makes when declared by South, precisely because
West's spades are too good.
</p><p>
West leads a high spade, and declarer wins in dummy, plays the <heart
card="A"/> and ruffs a heart, then crosses with the <club card="A"/>
and ruffs another heart, then plays the <club cards="KQ"/>, ending in
dummy, and exits a trump, which West must win, leading to this
position:

What is West to do? If he exits a low diamond, declarer wins in dummy,
and exits in a high trump, forcing West to lead again from diamonds.
</p><p>
If West exits a high diamond, declarer wins in hand, crosses in diamonds,
exits with a spade, and West must lead a diamond to declarer's queen.
</p><p>
If West takes two rounds of trumps, then exits in diamonds, declarer gets
two diamond tricks and the long club.
</p><p>
And if West takes one round of trumps, then exits in diamonds, we reach
our common end position, the one that keeps showing up in this collection:

On the play of the club, West can either ruff and be endplayed, or pitch
a diamond.  In any event, West only gets one more trick.
