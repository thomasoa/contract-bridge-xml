<p>
Notrump makes at most 10 tricks with repeated spade leads.
Declarer has four club tricks, and two tricks in each other suit.
</p><p>
In hearts or diamonds, it is impossible to avoid a trump loser,
so if the defense takes its ace off the top, declarer is stuck
at 11 tricks.
</p><p>
The <contract code="6C"/> contract, however, is cold. 
It is not hard at all to ruff out the hearts, draw trumps,
and take your twelve tricks.
