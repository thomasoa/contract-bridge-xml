It looks like East/West always have two defensive tricks, but looks can
be deceiving. If North declares any slam, of course, East can lead a heart
and no more than 11 tricks can be taken. But what if South declares?
</p><p>
In clubs, there are obvious trump losers.
</p><p>
In hearts, there's the eventual trump loser(s) as well as the 
<club card="A"/>.
</p><p>
Against a spade contract, West leads a diamond.   Declarer can finesse
the spade, then play the king and <spade card="A"/> then run diamonds, pitching
from hand, but what?  Nothing he pitches avoids two losers in clubs or a club
loser and a heart loser.
</p><p>
In fact, only <contract code="6D"/> makes.
</p><p>
Say West takes a passive diamond lead, won in dummy.  Declarer draws four
rounds of trumps, then leads a low club off dummy and East is caught:

If East plays the ace, South wins the return, unblocks the clubs then
pitches two hearts from dummy on the long spade and the club king.
</p><p>
If East ducks, South wins and runs the spades, pitching the club queen
from dummy.  He then plays <heart card="A"/> and <heart card="J"/>, West getting the king,
but East never getting the ace.
</p><p>
This an example of what is called "Morton's Fork" - East is damned if
he takes the ace, and damned if he doesn't.
