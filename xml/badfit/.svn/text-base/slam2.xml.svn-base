<p>
A <contract code="6H"/> contract fails because North/South must lose a heart to the defense, and
can't time that loss so that the defense must break the spade suit.
<contract code="6N"/> fails because there are nine top tricks and the situation in
the spade suit means that suit cannot be set up for extra tricks
without losing two spades, while there is only one extra trick
in each of hearts and clubs.
</p><p>
Indeed, the only slam to make on this deal is <contract code="6D"/>.
</p><p>
Say the defense leads a diamond.  Declarer wins the <diamond card="J"/> and plays the <club cards="AK"/> and ruffs a club, crosses to the <heart card="A"/>, draws trumps, and ducks a heart.  Declarer gets three hearts, a spade, four diamonds, three clubs, and a club ruff.

My original line was more complex - thanks to Richard Pavlicek
for pointing out this far simpler line.
