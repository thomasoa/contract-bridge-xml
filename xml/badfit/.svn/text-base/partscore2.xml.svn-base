South can, with care, make <contract code="2N"/>.  I'll leave that to the reader.
</p><p>
Perversely, East/West have a sacrifice in clubs.
</p><p>
In <contract code="3C"/> by East/West, the obvious defense is to lead
a trump.  East wins the <club card="A"/>, plays the <spade
card="A"/>, ruffs a spade, crosses back to the <diamond card="K"/>,
ruffs another spade, plays the <diamond card="A"/> and
another diamond, ruffed with the <club card="3"/>, and finally a
fourth round of spades, ruffed in West, and overruffed in North,
reaching this position:

Notice, you've stripped North/South of all but hearts and clubs.  They
get to take their trumps but then have to concede a heart trick at
the end, giving the defense five tricks, for -100, if doubled.
