<p>North/South can make 10 tricks in notrump or spades, or 11 tricks in diamonds, but their best score is in hearts, where they can make 11 tricks.</p>
<p>The defense needs to lead trumps to cut down on spade ruffs.  North wins the heart ace and leads a club, East forced to split his honors.</p>
<p>South wins the ace, plays the ace and king of diamonds, ruffs a diamond in North, leads a club, finessing East's remaining honor, then takes the remaining club winner to this position:</p>

<p>South plays a last club, and North ruffs with the heart nine, East unable to overruff.  Now North cashes the <card code="SA"/> and ruffs a spade with the <card code="H7"/>. Finally, South leads a diamond at this position:</p>
