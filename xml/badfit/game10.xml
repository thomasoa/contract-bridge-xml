<p>North/South can make nine tricks in notrump, but their best contract is <contract code="4S"/> by South.</p>
<p>Say West leads his stiff heart.</p>
<p>North wins, takes the ace of diamonds, diamond finesse, and the diamond king, pitching a club.  A diamond ruff, overruffing East if necessary, followed by two top clubs and a club ruff.  West remains with only spades, so South leads a heart and West ruffs low leading to this position (assuming East ruffed ahead of you with the <card:SJ/> at some point:)</p>

<p>West has to let you score two trump tricks, one now, and one when you lead a heart again.</p>
<p>That's on top of three diamonds, two clubs, a heart, and two minor suit ruffs.</p>
<p>If East doesn't ruff the fourth diamond (or third club after pitching on the fourth diamond,) then the end position is:</p>

<hand seat="E"  sp="J4" he="KQ" di="" cl=""/>

<p>Again West has to give you two of your three remaining trumps.</p>
