<contract code="5C"/> and 
<contract code="5D"/> both lose at least three tricks in the minors.
</p><p>
Declarer has eight top tricks in no trump, and it looks like he should be
able to set up a nineth trick somewhere, but it doesn't materialize.
</p><p>
The only game which makes is <contract code="4H"/>, declared by South.
</p><p>
On a non-diamond lead, declarer ruffs a spade, draws three rounds
of trumps, and cashes the club winners.  Declarer then ducks a diamond to
West:

West can take his long trump, but then must attack the diamonds.
If he leads a high one, declarer ducks.  In any event, declarer
will score the <diamond card="A"/> and <diamond card="J"/>.
</p>
<p>
If West had started with a diamond lead, declarer would duck the first
round, and West would have to shift.  The end position would be
substantially the same.
</p><p>
If <contract code="4H"/> is declared by North, however, East could
lead a diamond and set the contract.
