<p>This deal was found by Bert Beentjes.
</p>
<p>
Nobody can make <contract code="1N"/> or any two-level contract. So
that leaves one-level contracts. Can East/West make <contract
code="1S"/>? Against spades, the defense runs three clubs, the diamond
ace, and the heart ace. North then leads a fourth club at this
position:
<diagram>
<hand seat="N" sp="J97" he="T8" di="T6" cl="^J"/>
<hand seat="W" sp="AT654" he="K" di="KJ" cl=""/>
<hand seat="E" sp="K32" he="QJ64" di="4" cl=""/>
<hand seat="S" sp="Q8" he="97" di="AQ98" cl=""/>
</diagram>
</p>
<p>If East pitches or ruffs low, South ruffs with the spade queen,
which gives North/South two trump tricks. 
</p>
<p>If East ruffs high, North/South also get two trump tricks.</p>
<p>East/West cannot make <contract code="1S"/>, but perversely,
North/South can.</p>
<p>
To avoid the promotion, East/West might start with the king and ace of
trumps, and then attack diamonds.

South wins the diamond ace, crosses to the club king, plays the trump
jack, and then finesses in clubs.  South then cashes the club ace, and
leads a low heart.  
</p>
<p>If West plays small on the heart, win the ace and
exit to West in hearts leading to this position:
<diagram>
<hand seat="N" sp="" he="T" di="T6" cl="J"/>
<hand seat="W" sp="T6" he="" di="KJ" cl=""/>
<hand seat="E" sp="" he="QJ6" di="4" cl=""/>
<hand seat="S" sp="" he="9" di="Q98" cl=""/>
</diagram>
West, stuck on lead, must give up a trick in diamonds.
</p>
<p>If West plays the heart king on the first heart, North plays low,
and West is stuck on lead at this position:
<diagram>
<hand seat="N" sp="" he="AT" di="T6" cl="J"/>
<hand seat="W" sp="T6" he="5" di="KJ" cl=""/>
<hand seat="E" sp="" he="QJ64" di="4" cl=""/>
<hand seat="S" sp="" he="97" di="Q98" cl=""/>
</diagram>
West can't lead diamonds without giving up a seventh trick to
North/South.  If he exits imeddiately in hearts, North wins the ace
and leads the club jack.  West must ruff this, and now is stuck
leading diamonds.  And if West plays of his trumps before exiting in
hearts, North scores the club jack.
</p>
<p>
So par on this board is <contract code="1S"/> by North/South.
