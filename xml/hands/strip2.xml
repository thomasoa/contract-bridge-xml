West led an unfortunate <heart card="Q"/>, which declarer won in dummy.
Declarer then finessed in diamonds, and ran diamonds.  West had to find
four pitches.  The first three were two hearts and a club.  But on the
last diamond, West is stuck:
<diagram>
<hand seat="N" sp="AK62" he="J6" di="" cl="92"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="T974" he="Q" di="" cl="KJT"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="J8" he="97" di="" cl="A743"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="Q53" he="8" di="^7" cl="Q65"/>
</diagram>
West cannot part with a spade, or the <heart card="Q"/>, so he must
part with another club.  Declarer can now lead a heart towards the
jack, and East/West can only take two club tricks before conceding the
rest. 
</p><p>
Of course, this line fails when the spades were 3-3, but then West
might pitch a spade.  When West pitches the <club card="T"/>
or <club card="J"/>, declarer might figure the hand out.
