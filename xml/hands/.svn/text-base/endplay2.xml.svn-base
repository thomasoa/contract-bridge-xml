Dave Metcalf (sphinx on OKbridge and a regular face-to-face partner of mine
in the early 90s) played this hand nicely to make his contract,
with a little help from the bidding.  As his partner,
I have to admit, I passed <call code="3H"/> not due to any caution or wisdom on
my part, but because I thought Dave had opened <call code="1D"/>.  I'm not sure what
to make of Dave's <call code="3S"/> call - he certainly isn't ready for a
<call code="4D"/> call if he reopens with a double, and his spade suit is pretty good.
Pass is an unpleasant option, although not unreasonable.
</p><p>
The <club card="Q"/> was led, and Dave won the <club card="A"/>, cashed the <club card="K"/>,
and ruffed a club, West's jack falling.  Dave led a trump to the king, which
won.  Crossing with the <diamond card="A"/>, he led another trump, and East
flew the ace, West showing out.  East exited a heart, which Dave
won with the ace.
</p>
<diagram id="start">

<hand seat="S" sp="QT9" he="8" di="9" cl="9"/>
</diagram>

<p>
It looks like Dave still had to lose a trump, a diamond and a heart,
but Dave made an inspired play - he cashed the <spade card="Q"/> and the good
<club card="9"/>, pitching hearts from dummy, then threw East in with the trump.
East could cash the <diamond card="K"/>, but then had to give up a trick in diamonds,
allowing Dave to pitch his heart loser.
</p><p>
If West had been quiet on the auction, we would either have played
<contract code="3S"/>, making, or <contract code="4S"/>, which would
be down one when Dave took the diamond finesse.  The
bidding gave Dave enough information, though - West showed up with
the <heart cards="KJxxxx"/> and <club cards="QJx"/>, so he was quite
unlikely to have the <diamond card="K"/> as well.  Also, East was marked with only 
the one heart, so it was a sure thing that he was left with only
diamonds at the end when he was thrown in with a trump.
</p><p>
So again, let me argue passionately for passing.  We often see
cases where preempts and overcalls win, but we rarely comtemplate the subtle
instances when they lose.  Against a good player, describing your hand
can be very dangerous.
</p><p>
I've had spectacular wins when I've failed to overcall.  While it is
nice to find that nine-card solid fit during the auction, it is much
nicer to find it on opening lead against <contract code="3N"/>.
It is often nice to conceal those 6-1 and 7-1 breaks in side-suits, as well.
