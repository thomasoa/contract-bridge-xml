West lead the <spade card="4"/>, and East won the queen when declarer played low
from dummy.
</p><p>
Clearly, from East's point of view, continuing spades
wasn't much help, so he shifted to the <diamond card="4"/>.  Declarer ducked,
West won the <diamond card="9"/>, and continued with the <diamond card="5"/>
to East's jack, declarer ducking again.
</p><p>
East got out with a safe club, and declarer ran his club tricks.
West pitched a spade on the third club, but at the fourth club, West
was in a bind:

Declarer has won four tricks and has four more top tricks.  If West
pitches a diamond, declarer gets another diamond trick.   If West pitches
a spade, declarer gets another spade trick.  So West is forced to pitch
the <heart card="T"/>.
</p><p>
This pitch allows declarer to cash the top spades, pitching another diamond
and a heart, then lead the <heart card="Q"/>.  East is forced to cover, and West's
<heart card="J"/> is pinned.  Declarer can either duck, leaving East endplayed
in hearts, or win.  Either way, South can set up a second heart trick.
</p><p>
This line was found while we were kibbitzing double-dummy.  Is there
any reason to take this line rather than simply playing for the 3-3
diamond split?  I don't think so.
