West led the <spade card="4"/> against this game.  Declarer inexplicably
played low, winning East's nine with the ace.
</p><p>
Declarer sees a probable three clubs, two hearts, two diamonds, and two spades.
But timing is everything on this sort of hand, and of course, clubs
might not behave.
</p><p>
Declarer started with a heart to the jack, East winning the king.
East exited with the <heart card="T"/>, won by declarer.
</p><p>
Declarer next attacked clubs,  leading a low club to the jack, which won.
Declarer continued clubs, East showing out, pitching a diamond.
Unfortunate - the trick count is down to eight now.
</p><p>
Declarer ducked this club to West's 10, and West exited in hearts.  Declarer
pitched a club from dummy, winning in hand.
</p><p>
Here is the end position with seven tricks left to go (double dummy):

</diagram>

Declarer led a low spade to the queen, guessing wrong, but East was
endplayed.  After cashing the high heart, he was forced to lead
a diamond. Declarer guessed right to play the jack.  Declarer then
played two more rounds of diamonds, and West was pinched:

<hand seat="S" sp="" he="" di="^9" cl="AQ"/>
</diagram>
A double whammy - an endplay followed by a squeeze.
</p><p>
Making <call code="3N"/> was worth 2.12 IMPs, but going down one
would have been worth -7.84 IMPs, for close to a 10 IMP swing.
