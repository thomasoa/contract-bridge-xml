West leads a heart to East's king and your ace.
You have gotten to a satisfying slam.  
You have 12 top tricks, can you find a way to take the 13th?
</p><p>
At first, you might think to try to ruff good the spades. Play 
<spade card="A"/>, ruff a spade, ruff a heart, ruff a spade, then
take the <diamond cards="AQ"/> If spades are splitting 4-3 and
diamonds 2-1, you make an overtrick.
</p><p>
There is a slight risk in this line.  If spades are 4-3 and
diamonds a 3-0 with the long diamond in the hand with the three-card spade
suit, you may never be able to cash your second top spade without someone
ruffing.  This is only a slight risk, because East would have to be
void in clubs to hold three spades and three diamonds.  Wouldn't West lead the
<club card="A"/> if he had seven of them, looking for partner's ruff?
West might  be hold three spades and three diamonds, but that would have 
East opening with three spades also.
</p><p>
But why take the risk?  There is a squeeze option on this hand. 
Indeed, as the cards lie, it is the only way to make the overtrick.
If West has five or more spades and the <club card="A"/>, as he has here,
you can squeeze him on the run of the red suit winners.
</p><p>
I did not see the squeeze on this hand, even though I was kibbitzing
double dummy.  Someone had to point it out to me.  This was a pattern
recognition problem.  If South had held a doubleton spade and the
stiff <club card="K"/>, I certainly would have seen it, but for some
reason I did not see the king as a threat card in the
<holding cards="K7"/> holding.
</p><p>
East makes things only slightly more difficult for you if he ducks
the heart.  Then you have to ruff a heart before you draw trumps.
This can be done at no risk, however.
