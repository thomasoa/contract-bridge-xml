<p>
North's double is not to my taste.  Perhaps it was made in frustration;
East/West were a famous bridge father and son, and they were
clobbering the talented North/South pair.
</p><p>
West led a low heart, ducked to his partner's queen.  East, spying the
potential for a club ruff in dummy, switched to a spade.  West
cleared away dummy's trumps, playing the ace, king, and a third trump.
</p><p>
Declarer played a club to the ace, a diamond to the king, and a
diamond, West winning the <diamond card="A"/>.  West exited a heart,
won in dummy. Declarer ruffed a heart, getting to this end position:

<hand seat="S" sp="T" he="" di="" cl="KT9"/>
</diagram>
Declarer led the <club card="T"/>, and West could either duck or be
end-played.  In either event, declarer got three of the last four
tricks.
</p><p>
Making was worth 4 IMPs and down one would have been worth -1.25 IMPs,
for a total swing of 5.25 IMPs.
