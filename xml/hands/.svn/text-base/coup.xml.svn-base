West led the <heart cards="AK"/>, then continued with a small heart,
which I ruffed low in dummy.  East followed to all three rounds, showing
up with <heart cards="QJ3"/>.  It looks like East might find a heart lead
after a more normal <auction type="inline"><call code="1N"/><call code="3N"/></auction> auction, so we've found a good spot.
</p><p>
I started drawing trumps, playing the ace and the king, and West showed out
on the second round.  As usual, my opponents are playing above their level
against me - if my left-hand opponent had not forced me to ruff in dummy,
I could have taken care against the 4-1 trump split.
</p><p>
Well, there was nothing left to do but hope my RHO had at least three
clubs and two spades.  I played out my club winners from hand,
both following to all three rounds, leading to this position:

<hand seat="E"  sp="xxx" he="" di="Jx" cl=""/>
<hand seat="S" sp="42" he="" di="QT7" cl=""/>
</diagram>
</p><p>
I crossed to the <spade card="A"/> and ruffed the <club card="A"/>, East
pitching a spade.  Then I crossed to the <spade card="K"/>, and with
the lead in dummy at this trick:
<diagram>
<hand seat="N" sp="J3" he="" di="" cl=""/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="" he="" di="Jx" cl=""/>
<hand seat="S" sp="" he="" di="QT" cl=""/>
</diagram>
I got the last two tricks.
</p><p>
Notice I could have overtaken the third club and ruffed a small
club in my hand, but then if East had four clubs, this would
technically be a simple trump coup, while ruffing the ace makes
it a "Grand Coup."  Indeed, you can't get any grander than ruffing
your own ace.
