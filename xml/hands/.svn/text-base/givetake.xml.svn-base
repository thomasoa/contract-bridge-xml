West heeded his partner's overcall, and led his stiff club.
</p><p>
Reading the writing on the wall, declarer flew up with the ace,
led a low diamond to the jack, crossed to the <heart card="A"/> and
ruffed a heart.  Declarer then cashed another diamond, glad for
the good break, crossed to the <spade card="A"/>, and ruffed another heart,
felling East's king, at this position:

<hand seat="E"  sp="" he="" di="" cl="KT9853"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="85" he="" di="T97" cl="J"/>
</diagram></p>
<p>With the lead in hand, declarer lead the <club card="J"/>.  Upon winning
this trick, East would have to give entry to dummy's two queens,
allowing declarer to pitch his spades.
</p>
<p>
But our East was cleverer - she simply let declarer win the 
<club card="J"/>.  A simple play, but one which entirely destroyed
declarer. By giving up the only trick in her hand, she also kept declarer
from reaching dummy, and West 
scored two spade tricks.</p>
