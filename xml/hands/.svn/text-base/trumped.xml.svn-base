<p>
This is the sort of ill-conceived auction that one can have when opening
with little defense.  It is probably right for East to pull the double
due to his pathetic defensive values and diamond void.
</p><p>
West led the <heart card="6"/>, and East contributed the jack.
Declarer, Marvin Elster (<em>magpie</em> on OKbridge,) won in hand,
crossed to the <heart card="K"/>, finessed with the <spade card="Q"/>,
then cashed the <spade card="A"/>.  Marvin then cashed a single
top trump, finding the expected bad break.
</p><p>
Marvin exited a spade, and West pitched a heart.  East led a heart, and Marvin
pitched his club.  When East next led a club, Marvin ruffed in hand, and led
his fourth spade at this position:
<diagram>
<hand seat="N" sp="" he="" di="J3" cl="Q96"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="" he="" di="QT7" cl="A5"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="K" he="87" di="" cl="KJ"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="^8" he="" di="K986" cl=""/>
</diagram>
West clearly could not afford to ruff this, high or low.  So
West pitched a club.  Marvin ruffed in dummy, ruffed a club, then
exited with the <diamond card="9"/>.  West had to give the last two tricks to
Marvin, who made an overtrick.
</p><p>
If East had cashed his <club card="K"/> before playing the third
heart, Marvin would have had to ruff, and then West could overruff and
hold the contract to three.
</p><p>
There was no way to set this contract.  The results on this board
were all over the map:
