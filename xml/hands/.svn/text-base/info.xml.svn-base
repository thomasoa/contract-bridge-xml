North and South bid up to <contract code="6S"/> on this hand.
</p><p>
This slam looks pretty easy, if thing break nicely.  Whenever that's
the case, it is worth looking for safety plays.
</p><p>
West led the <diamond card="Q"/>, which declarer, Guss Ginsburg, won in hand.
His intention was to draw trumps in three rounds, cash the rest of
the red suit winners, and exit with the third round of diamonds.
Whichever opponent won would have to break the club suit or concede
a ruff and discard to Guss. 
</p><p>
Unfortunately, East pitched a heart on the second spade.  The
plan was going to have to change. Guss played out the rest of his trumps, 
and East continued to pitch hearts.  Guss then ducked a diamond.
West won and exited a heart, won in dummy.  Guss then cashed the
rest of his diamonds and hearts.  On the <diamond card="K"/>, East
pitched a heart.
</p><p>
So, Guss can count out West's hand somewhat.  West started with five
diamonds, four spades and at least two hearts.  Therefore, West started with
at most two clubs.  Guss played off the <club cards="KQ"/>, and when
West showed out, Guss claimed, taking the marked finesse.
</p><p>
The diamond duck is a fairly basic play, but not many people found it at
the table.  Even without it, most who played this hand guessed East
for the club length.
