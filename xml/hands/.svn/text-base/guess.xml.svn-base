This is not a great slam, depending on me guessing the <club card="Q"/>.
I sought to find out all I could before making that guess.
</p><p>
I cashed the <diamond card="A"/>, cashed three rounds of trumps, East
showing up with two.  I then ran three hearts, East showing up with two.
</p><p>
Figuring many Easts would find a call over <call code="1C"/>
holding seven diamonds, I figured West started with four or more
diamonds, along with his three spades and four hearts.  Therefore, he
probably had two or fewer clubs. That meant that the odds favored East
holding the <club card="Q"/>.
</p><p>
For once the odds were right for me:

<hand seat="W"  sp="T62" he="J832" di="K653" cl="96"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="85" he="74" di="QJ9742" cl="Q73"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="AQ74" he="Q65" di="T8" cl="A852"/>
</diagram>

Making was worth 11 Imps, down one would have been -12.7 Imps.
