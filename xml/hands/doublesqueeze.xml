North opened a slightly odd strong notrump, and South made a few too many
slam tries, finally landing in <contract code="5S"/> contract.
</p><p>
West found the good lead of a spade.  Declarer won in dummy, and led
a heart to the king.  If the <heart card="A"/> was onside, declarer would
have only two heart losers.   Sadly, West won and continued spades, East
following.
</p><p>
Declarer won and cashed the <diamond card="A"/> and ruffed a diamond,
East playing the king.  After drawing the last trump, declarer
ducked a heart at this position (pitching a diamond from dummy:)

West won and returned a diamond, East pitching a heart, and declarer
ruffing.  Declarer then cashed the <heart card="Q"/> (pitching a diamond
from dummy).  If East started with four or more hearts, the position would
be something like:
<diagram>
<hand seat="N" sp="" he="" di="7" cl="AT9"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="" he="" di="Q" cl="Qxx"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="" he="9" di="" cl="Jxx"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="^T" he="6" di="" cl="K6"/>
</diagram>
</p><p>
On the <spade card="T"/>, West can not part with a diamond, so he must part
with a club.  Declarer pitches the diamond from dummy, and East is
now caught in the squeeze, forced to part with either a heart, setting
up the heart in declarers hand, or a club.
</p><p>
As it was, West showed out on the third round of hearts, having started
with <holding cards="H:AJ"/> tight.  Declarer could have claimed on learning that West
was guarding the diamonds and East the hearts.
</p><p>
Was there any better defense?  
</p><p>
The full hand was:
<diagram>
<hand seat="N" sp="AQ" he="T7" di="A76532" cl="AT9"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="76" he="AJ" di="QJ98" cl="QJ542"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="J43" he="98543" di="K4" cl="873"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="KT9852" he="KQ62" di="T" cl="K6"/>
</diagram>
West couldn't duck the heart, because
he was holding the <heart cards="AJ"/>.  If he had played the jack, declarer's
ten in dummy would have become a useful card, and again declarer would
have lost only two heart tricks.
Could West have broken up the squeeze?  I don't see an obvious way.
</p><p>
As you can see, the clubs are both in West's hand.  Technically, East
was never squeezed as the cards lie.  The club situation keeps West
from ever leading clubs.  If East had both clubs, West could lead
clubs every time.  The spade lead was necessary to keep declarer from
ruffing out his diamonds - two of his entries to dummy are in spades,
but to be useful for setting up diamonds, they needed to be used after
the diamonds ace entry had been used.
