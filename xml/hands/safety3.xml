West led the <club card="Q"/>, and East played the <club card="J"/>, declarer ducking.
</p><p>
West then shifted to the <heart card="J"/>.  This was covered in dummy
by the <heart card="Q"/>, East played the <heart card="K"/> and
declarer won the <heart card="A"/>.
</p><p>
Declarer (geno on OKbridge) now appeared to have nine tricks; three spades,
four or five diamonds, and two hearts.  But if East got in before the tricks
could be run, he would be able to lead a club through declarer's king.
</p><p>
Declarer therefore took a basic safety play, playing a diamond to the
ace.  He was rewarded when East dropped the <diamond card="K"/>.  Had 
declarer taken the finesse, he would have been down 3, and if West had
the king, when he won it, he couldn't safely attack clubs.

The full deal was:

West might set this contract by initially leading a low club to East's jack.
Declarer would have to win.  Then it is no longer "safe" for declarer
to take the <diamond card="A"/> first.  Still, would West have passed South's
<call code="1D"/> opening bid with a good club suit <em>and</em> the 
<diamond card="K"/> at
favorable vulnerability?  An argument can be made to play for the drop still,
depending on West's overcalling style.
