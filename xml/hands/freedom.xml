<p>North led a spade to South's jack and West's queen.  Declarer led a
club to dummy's king, and then led a diamond to the jack and north's
queen. North continued trumps, South winning.  South shifted to a
club, won by West's ace. West then lead a heart to dummy's queen, and
a diamond back to the ace, and then cashes the club
queen, pitching a heart from dummy.  Declarer then led the club ten at
this position:

<p>North followed, dummy ruffed, and South pitched a heart. North is
known to have the ace of hearts and the last trump (or south would have
overruffed.)  So when declarer calls for the heart off dummy, and
south plays the ten, declarer can play low, sticking north in this
position:</p>

<hand seat='E' sp='K' he='^7' di='43' cl=''/>
<hand seat='S' sp='' he='J^T' di='K7' cl=''/>
</diagram>
<p>If South is allowed to win the heart, declarer scores the last
three tricks on a cross-ruff.  If north overtakes and leads a trump,
declarer scores two trumps and a heart.</p>
