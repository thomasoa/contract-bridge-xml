West led the <club card="Q"/>, East encouraged with the <club card="T"/>,
and declarer, Hao on OKbridge, ducked.  West continued a low club to
East's king, again ducked, and East continued a club to the ace.
</p><p>
If diamonds split, Hao had ten top tricks and is looking for an
eleventh, which can only possibly come from hearts or spades.
</p><p>
Hao took the <spade card="A"/> and <spade card="Q"/>, crossed to hand
with the <diamond card="A"/>,
cashed the <spade card="K"/>, pitching a heart, and ran the diamonds.
East, who started with four spades and the <heart card="K"/>, was
squeezed on the last diamond:

</diagram>
</p><p>
If East pitches a spade, declarer pitches the <heart card="8"/> and has
two winners left in his hand.  If East pitches the heart, declarer pitches
his spade, and has two heart tricks.
</p><p>
As a sign that OKbridge play might be improving, making four was worth only
7%, while making five was worth 64%.  Either a lot of people found the
squeeze, or a lot of Easts pitched a spade early.
