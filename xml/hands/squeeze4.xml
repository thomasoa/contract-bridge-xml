North was a little light for his <call code="2N"/> rebid, which
usually shows at least 17-18.  Still, I sympathize somewhat.  He does
not have enough to reverse to <call code="2S"/>, and a 
<call code="2H"/> bid sounds weak.  <call code="2C"/> and 
<call code="2D"/> are unpleasant options. 
</p><p>
West led the <club card="K"/>, East overtook with the ace and continued
with the <club card="J"/>.  This held, and East shifted to a low spade.
West won the ace and continued the spade.
</p><p>
The contract is in the bag, and you don't want to waste too much time
hunting for an overtrick at imps.  If hearts are 3-3, you have an overtrick,
but what if hearts are 4-2?  If West holds the length with his presumed
<club card="Q"/>, you can squeeze him.
</p><p>
So you win the spade, and run two more spades, pitching a club, then you
run three diamond tricks, pitching a heart, to this end position:
</p><p>

<hand seat="N" sp="" he="AKQ8" di="" cl=""/>
<hand seat="S" sp="" he="T2" di="" cl="T7"/>
</diagram>
West can no longer hold four hearts and the <club card="Q"/>.
</p><p>
While this squeeze is inconsequential - the overtrick amounts to only
half an imp here - it is such a basic squeeze that it should
be found.  This is like failing to take a risk-free finesse for an
overtrick, and it requires only slight timing considerations - namely,
taking the spades before the diamonds, so that you end up in your hand
at the four-card end position above.
</p><p>
Here is the complete deal:

<hand seat="N" sp="Q982" he="AKQ84" di="KQ" cl="62"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="KJT" he="T2" di="AJT" cl="T7543"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="A6" he="J976" di="964" cl="KQ98"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="7543" he="53" di="87532" cl="AJ"/>
</diagram>
Those Wests who found a low club lead set this contract - East wins
the first two clubs, then shifts to a spade, and West cashes out,
for down 1.
