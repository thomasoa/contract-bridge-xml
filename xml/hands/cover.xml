<p>
West led a trump, and declarer won in hand and pulled the rest
of the trumps. Declarer then led the <diamond card="J"/>, 
ducked all around.  When declarer led the <diamond card="4"/>
from hand, it was necessary for West to fly the queen, to block the suit,
preventing South from from gaining entry to dummy to lead hearts.
</p><p>
If South had continued with the <diamond card="T"/>, West would have
to duck, again to deny South a diamond entry.
</p><p>
In other words, the only way to keep South from gaining an entry
to dummy on this hand is to duck if South leads the <diamond card="J"/>
or <diamond card="T"/>, and fly the queen if South leads the 
<diamond card="4"/>.
