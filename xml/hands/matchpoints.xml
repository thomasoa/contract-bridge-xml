<p>
West found an unfortunate spade lead, which had disasterous matchpoint
consequences.  Moxie, my partner, won in hand and played the <diamond card="A"/> and, noting East's <diamond card="J"/>, ducked a diamond, West winning.  West
made another fateful mistake, playing off two top hearts.  He then
exited with the <club card="Q"/>, won in dummy.
</p><p>
Moxie crossed to hand with the <heart card="Q"/>, and lead another diamond,
West playing his king.  West exited the <club card="J"/>, won by declarer.
The damage was already done.
</p><p>
Moxie scored three spades, one heart, two diamonds, and two clubs, for
eight tricks.
</p><p>
How much did that one trick gain?  Here are the results from the board:
