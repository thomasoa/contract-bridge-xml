West leads the <club card="6"/> against three notrump.  How can we make
this contract?
</p><p>
We clearly can't attack spades, because the opponents will likely
take two spades and three clubs before we can set up tricks.
</p><p>
That means we will have to rely on the heart finesse.  We can get a club
trick, four diamond tricks (assuming that suit behaves), and four
heart tricks.
</p><p>
The only problem with this plan is that we can only take the heart finesse
once.  That works okay if East has only three hearts to the queen, but
West's <club card="6"/> is probably from a five-card suit.
</p><p>
When this was played out at an OKbridge tournament, many declarers ducked
the club.  A few made the inspired play of the <club card="K"/>.  Those who did
were rewarded with this full deal:

<hand seat="W"  sp="953" he="972" di="J" cl="AQ7653"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="AK2" he="Q854" di="8743" cl="T8"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="T7" he="AKJT" di="AKT9" cl="J92"/>
</diagram>
</p><p>
There is certainly a danger in playing the <club card="K"/> to the first
trick - you could go down a lot that way.  Still, I think that is the better
plan.</p>
