Our declarer today is <link rel='external' href="http://www.gibware.com/">Matt Ginsberg's "GIB"</link> program.  GIB has some strange ideas about bidding,
including a tendency to open <call code="1N"/> rather often. <em>[ This was as of 1997 - GIB's bidding has improved since.]</em>
</p><p>
West led the <club card="Q"/>, and GIB could do no better or worse
than the average human, winning in hand.
</p><p>
Short of entries, GIB exited its hand with the <diamond card="T"/>,
which West won with the queen. East signaled, mysteriously,
with the <diamond card="8"/>. East's signal was going to prove costly under
the eagle eye of GIB.
</p><p>
West continued the <club card="J"/>, which GIB won in dummy, pitching a
small heart from hand.  GIB then took the spade finesse, which
won, and exited with the <diamond card="K"/>, pitching a spade from dummy.
</p><p>
East won and led the <heart card="J"/>, GIB covered and West won
the <heart card="A"/>.  West exited with the <spade card="9"/>, on which
East contributed his king, and GIB won the ace.  GIB was at this position:
</p><p>
<diagram original="start">
<hand seat="N" sp="" he="T95" di="" cl="975"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="" he="Q73" di="" cl="Q32"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="T5" he="6" di="J42" cl=""/>
<hand seat="S" sp="J2" he="8" di="T63" cl=""/>
</diagram>
GIB led the <heart card="8"/>, and West very smoothly ducked.  If West had
won the heart, he'd have to conceded four of the remaining tricks to dummy.
</p><p>
GIB then played <diamond card="T"/>, which East won.
</p><p>
East exited a spade,  and GIB won the jack.  When West failed to follow,
GIB "knew" exactly what East's remaining cards were,
found the endplay for the overtrick, throwing in East in with the
last spade.
</p><p>
East was forced to lead from his <diamond cards="42"/> into GIB's 
<diamond cards="63"/>, giving GIB
an overtrick.
</p><p>
If East had ducked the <diamond card="T"/>, GIB was still going to make its
overtrick, by immediately playing the <spade cards="J2"/>, forcing
East to lead from <diamond cards="J4"/> into <diamond cards="63"/>.
