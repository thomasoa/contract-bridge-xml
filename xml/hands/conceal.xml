North's <call code="6H"/> bid was an aggressive tactical bid.  There is 
a risk of missing a grand or going off in six, but the immediate bid has the
advantage of muddying the defense.
</p><p>
For instance, here, by not showing his spades or his club shortness,
our intrepid North has not made the killing diamond lead obvious
to the defense.
</p><p>
Sadly, West finds the lead of the <diamond card="Q"/> anyway.  Is there any
way to save this contract?
</p><p>
There is.  If one defender started with a stiff <heart card="A"/> and
exactly two spades, you have a chance:
<diagram>
<hand seat="N" sp="AJ7542" he="87652" di="A2" cl=""/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="T9" he="A" di="QJ74" cl="T87632"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="863" he="T4" di="KT965" cl="AQ5"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="KQ" he="KQJ93" di="83" cl="KJ94"/>
</diagram>
You win the diamond lead, play a spade to the king, overtake the spade
queen with the ace, and play the <spade card="J"/>.  East must follow, you
pitch a diamond, and West can ruff with his natural trump trick.
</p><p>
This line also works anytime the person with the long spades has
all three hearts.
</p><p>
It also works when East has two spade and all three hearts.  In this
instance, East must ruff low on the third spade, declarer overruffs,
ruffs a club in dummy and plays another spade winner.  Again, East must
ruff low, and declarer overruffs, ruffs another club, and leads another
spade winner.  Whether East ruffs with the ace or not, declarer pitches
his diamond loser.
</p><p>
The declarer I watched simply gave up after the opening lead, leading
trumps immediately, praying, I suppose, that the opponents were too
blind to take their diamond  trick.  The opponents, staring at dummy,
could easily figure it out.  As it was, the cards were not favorable,
so declarer could not make his contract.  That does not excuse declare from
trying, however.  The difference between making and down one was 22 imps.
