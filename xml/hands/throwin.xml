<p>West led the <diamond card="2"/>, East won the ace and continued
with the <diamond card="9"/>.  Declarer played the jack, West won the
queen, and inexplicably shifted to a club.  Perhaps West thought that
partner had started with <holding cards="D:A93"/>.
</p><p>
Declarer lost the club finesses, and East continued with another diamond,
which declarer won.  (Declarer pitched two hearts from dummy on the
diamonds.)
</p><p>
Declarer played the <spade card="K"/> and <spade card="A"/>, and found
out about the bad spade split.  If spades had split remotely kindly,
<contract code="3N"/> would have been in the bag, with five spade
tricks, three clubs, and a diamond. 
</p><p>
Our declarer was still able to make his contract.  Running the clubs,
declarer came down to the following position:
<diagram original="start">
<hand seat="N" sp="QJ8" he="K" di="" cl="^J"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="T65" he="A" di="T" cl=""/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="" he="97" di="8" cl="7^6"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="" he="Q853^2" di="" cl=""/>
</diagram>
</p><p>
West can safely pitch a heart and a diamond of the first two clubs, but
now is stuck.  Obviously, he must keep the <heart card="A"/>, and just as
obviously, he must keep three spades. Therefore the only card to part
with is the <diamond card="T"/>.  Now declarer exits with the 
<heart card="K"/>, and West is forced to win and lead away from the
<spade card="T"/>. 
</p><p>
West's club switch was awful, and declarer was able to use it to
his advantage.  Remember, never give a sucker an even break.
</p>
<p>Larry Cohen noted that it is far better for declarer to not take the club finesse when West switched to clubs.  Then declarer can make if spades are 4-2 or better or hearts are 3-2 or a couple of other friendly instances such as west holding stiff ten or nine of hearts.</p>
