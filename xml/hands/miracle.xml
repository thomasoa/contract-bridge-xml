West found a poor low spade lead.  Declarer played low, East
played the queen, and declarer won in hand.  Declarer 
drew trumps ending in hand and played the <spade card="T"/>, ducked
around.  Declarer then played a club to the queen,
a diamond to the ace, and a club to ace, and pitched a club
on the <spade card="K"/>.  Declarer ruffed a club, arriving
at this position:

</diagram>
Declarer played a diamond from his hand, and West was forced to win the
queen.  West was caught in a throw-in, and had to give declarer a ruff and discard in one of the black suits.
</p><p>
West could have avoided this endplay by dropping the <diamond card="Q"/>
under the ace.  That was the main reason for taking the <diamond
card="A"/> before showing the position in the black suits.
</p><p>
Only six players who played <contract code="4H"/> got a spade lead.  Of those, only one player,
Curt Hastings (curt), found this extra overtrick.  It was worth a measly IMP,
but an IMP is an IMP.
