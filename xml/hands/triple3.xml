West led the <diamond card="K"/>, and continued with the <diamond card="Q"/>.
West then shifted to a low spade; East won, and shifted to a heart.
</p><p>
This defense was less than optimal, and declarer, Robin Pleau (robyn on
OKbridge), used it to find a surprising overtrick.  She won the trump shift
and ran her trumps, leading to this four-card end-position on the last
trump:
<diagram>
<hand seat="N" sp="" he="" di="" cl="AJ9^7"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="" he="" di="^7" cl="T43"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="A" he="" di="A" cl="K8"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="Q" he="^2" di="J" cl="Q"/>
</diagram>
On the last trump, East thought a long time, then pitched the 
<diamond card="A"/>, perhaps praying that his partner was 
holding the <diamond card="J"/>.
</p><p>
Robin cashed the now established <diamond card="J"/>, and again East was
squeezed, forced to ungaurd yet another suit.
</p><p>
Of course, East's best pitch at the four-card end-position would have
been a club.  Robin would get two clubs here, but would have to concede
a trick at the end to West's <club card="T"/>.
</p><p>
But in the above diagram, I've had West pitch perfectly.  In reality,
West did not value his club cards, and pitched two of them on the
hearts.
</p><p>
It was worth 71% to go plus on this board.  The overtrick
gave Robin a clear top.
