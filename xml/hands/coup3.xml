It would be hard not to double with East's hand, given that partner
has made a vulnerable preempt and East has what looks like three tricks
in hand.
</p><p>
West led the <diamond card="K"/>, and declarer, Jeff Miller (OldProf on
OKbridge,) won the ace in dummy and led the <heart card="7"/>, ducked
all around.  The <heart card="9"/> was then lead, again ducked all
around, West pitching a diamond.  
</p><p>
Jeff then led a high club off dummy, and East won. East then led a
diamond, and ruffed a diamond, leading to:

</diagram>
</p><p>
East exited a spade, and declarer won in hand, played a club to the queen,
ruffed the <club card="J"/>, and then ran the spades.   East was
caught in a coup, forced to ruff in front of declarer's ace-queen.
Somehow, with all those beautiful trumps, she managed to only score
one of them.
</p><p>
East can score two trump tricks by expending a high trump early.  Why?
Well, notice that when East got her diamond ruff, she was down to
king-jack-ten in trumps, so she was ruffing with one of the high cards, anyway.
By covering the <heart card="7"/>, she forces South to use a higher
trump, and she can ruff the diamond with one of her low trumps.
