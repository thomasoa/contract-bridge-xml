West led the <heart card="K"/>, ducked around.  I won the <heart card="J"/>
continuation, and exited a club.  East won and played a heart, which I ruffed,
West following.  I ruffed a club high, back with a trump, West pitching a
club. I ruffed another club, and again back with a trump. 
I took the spade finesse, and came back with a third round of trumps,
ending up in this position:

West pitched his clubs on the diamonds, but on the last diamond,
West was squeezed in the majors.
</p>
<p>
<holding cards="AQx"/> opposite <holding cards="Jxx"/> always screams
out to me.
In <link rel='internal' href="shutup">another hand</link>
in this collection, I give an example where West is stripped and
endplayed into giving up a third trick to this holding.
</p><p>
Perhaps this holding makes it easier for me to see the squeeze or
endplay possibilities.  I am already aware that I want the king of
the suit to be onside.  I visualize West with the king, 
and a key step in a squeeze or endplay is visualization.
</p><p>
The above squeeze works just as well if I have <holding cards="Jxx"/>
in hand and <holding cards="AKx"/> in
dummy, but I might be less inclined to find it because I'm not asking
myself, "what if West has the queen of spades?"
