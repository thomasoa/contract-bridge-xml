<title>Inline Hands</title>

<test title="Example">
<testbody>
<p> If I put a hand in a paragraph like this,
<hand sp="A8765432" he="QT9" di="" cl="KJ"/>,
it takes an inline format.
</p>
</testbody>
<testnote>
Notice that the hand is formatted with hyphens between the cards - this is 
Richard Pavlicek's recommendation.  I've allowed line breaks in the middle of the hand,
since hands tend to be long, but the line breaks must be between suits.
