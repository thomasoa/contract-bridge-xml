<title>HTML-like Tags</title>
<body>
<p>Most tags in these documents which look like HTML are 
transferred directly to the resulting HTML document.
I try to avoid using too much HTML in my documents because
I also translate the XML to XSL:FO, to generate PDFs, and
too much HTML means I have much more to do the translations.</p>
<test title="Paragraph">
<testbody>
<p>Paragraph 1</p>
<p>Paragraph 2</p>
</testbody>
<testnote>
This actually gets translated to a &lt;div> tag, because HTML paragraphs
don't like tables (like deal diagrams) in the middle.

<test title="Line Breaks">
<testbody>
In this instance, we add a line break here - <br/> to make sure that
code creates breaks properly.
