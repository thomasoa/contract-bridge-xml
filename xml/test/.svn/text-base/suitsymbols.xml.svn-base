Suit symbols can be included in any text.  These forms are
rarely used, but can be used in some instances, for example,
when you need a really brief description of a bid.  When writing
out a bid, see <link rel='internal' href="inline-calls">Calls</link>.  When
writing out a card or holding, use 
<link rel='internal' href="inline-holdings">Cards and Holdings</link>.

<p>
You could use suit symbols rather than &lt;call>,
&lt;holding>, etc., but then the formatter will not
know to do smart formatting things.  For example, 
you could write out cards as: <spade/> A, <spade/> K, 
<spade/> Q, <spade/> J, <spade/> 10, <spade/> 9,
<spade/> 8, <spade/> 7, <spade/> 6, <spade/> 5, 
<spade/> 4, <spade/> 3, <spade/> 2, <heart/> A, <heart/> K, 
<heart/> Q, <heart/> J, <heart/> 10, <heart/> 9,
<heart/> 8, <heart/> 7, <heart/> 6, <heart/> 5, 
<heart/> 4, <heart/> 3, <heart/> 2.  But then you might
see breaks in the middle of cards, obscuring your document.

Other reasons to avoid this might be issues of "accessability" - you might
want to generate a version of your document for the blind, in which
case, you'd want to change &lt;spade card="Q"/> to the words
"spade queen," so that the user's client could read the words out
loud.  In XML, as a rule, you do not want to make formatting decisions
too early, so that if you want to alter some of the overall look of your
documents, you'd have to change every individual document.
</p>
<p>
In other words, don't do this.
