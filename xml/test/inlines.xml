<p>Contract: <contract code="4C" declarer="S"/></p>

<p>Contract: <contract code="5S"/></p>

<p> When you have a choice of
    <contract code="4SXX" declarer="S"/> 
    or <contract code="5DX" declarer="N"/>,
    you'll probably prefer the diamond contract,
    unless you are a risk-taker.

<p>Darker red:
The heart finesse would be 50%, but it is slightly better than 50%
that the <heart card="K"/> and the <diamond card="Q"/> were in
different hands. You play the <heart card="A"/>, cash the 
<diamond card="K"/> and run the spades, pitching a diamond and the
<heart card="Q"/>.  You reach this position:
<diagram>
<hand seat="N" sp="" he="J" di="J" cl="3"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="" he="" di="" cl="KJ5"/>
</diagram>

The above &lt;span class="forcered"> is a gross hack so you can
see the difference between a darker red in the middle of a paragraph,
versus a bright red.  I find the bright red interrupts the flow
of the paragraph more, so I've set the formatter to use a bright red
only in diagrams, and use the darker red in the paragraphs. 
</p>
<p>These colors, as well as many of the other look decision, are
controlled by the  <link rel='onsite' href="/deals/article.css">CSS
file</link>, so I can tinker with these aspect without regenerating
the HTML.
