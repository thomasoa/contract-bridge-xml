<title>Links</title>
<body>
<p>
These features are not bridge-related, but I've included
these examples just for completeness. Note that the links
don't know whether they are opened in the same frame, the top
frame of the current window, or a new window.  This decision is
made in the XSL, based in whether the link is internal, part of
my site, or external.

<test title="Internal Link">
<testbody>
<link rel='internal' href="intro">This link</link>
should take you to the introduction of this book.
</testbody>
<testnote>
The "internal" link basically means that the link is a reference 
to another page in this same collection.  When generating PDF,
this is converted to an internal link in the document.  In HTML,
it loads the page in the current frame (when in a framed document.)

<test title="On-Site Links">
<testbody>
This is a gross hack to indicate pages on my site, such as the
<link rel='onsite' href="/deal/">Deal 3.0 page.</link>
</testbody>
<testnote>
This just lets me move my site more easily - a bit of a hack.
When generating PDF, the site location gets hard-coded.  In HTML,
causes the document to be loaded in the top frame.

<test title="External Link">
<testbody>
Many of the formatting decisions I've made are based on the
recommendations in Richard Pavlicek's
<link href="http://www.rpbridge.net/7z69.htm">Bridge
Writing Style Guide.</link>
</testbody>
<testnote>
A general link. In HTML, causes the referenced document to be 
loaded in the top frame.
