This is the first non-symmetric example with a six-card suit, and also
the first with eight-card fits.
</p>
<h2>Notrump</h2>
<p>
East/West have three spades and four diamonds off the top.
North/South have four clubs and six hearts.
</p>
<h2>Spades</h2>
<p>
With East/West declaring spades, North/South start with two top hearts
followed by four clubs, North ruffing the fourth round high.  East can't
avoid two trump losers.
</p><p>
With North/South declaring, the defense starts with three spades, then runs
four diamonds, East pitching a heart.  South can take his trump trick now or
later, but the defense still gets eight tricks.
</p>
<h2>Hearts</h2>
<p>
Against hearts by North/South, the defense starts with three spades
then four diamond, promoting East's <heart card="Q"/>.
</p><p>
East/West declaring is clearly pointless.
</p>
<h2>Diamonds</h2>
<p>
If North/South declare diamonds, East/West just take their four trumps and
three spades.  
</p><p>
If East/West declare diamonds, the defense starts with three top
clubs, North pitching two spades, then two top hearts followed by
a third high heart. 
</p><p>If East pitches, South also pitches and North just
continues hearts, promoting a trump trick for the defense.
So East must ruff. 
</p><p>If East ruffs low, South overruffs and leads
a spade, East winning, reaching this position:
</p>
<diagram original="base">
<hand seat="N" sp="" he="973" di="976" cl=""/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="" he="" di="KQ85" cl="87"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="KQ54" he="" di="A2" cl=""/>
<hand seat="S" sp="T87" he="" di="J3" cl="J"/>
</diagram>
<p>
East is on lead.  If he draws trumps, he can't get back to his
spades.  If he tries to cash a spade to pitch a club now, North
ruffs. There is no way of keeping East/West from scoring a seventh
trick.
</p><p>
So perhaps East should have ruffed the third heart high. South pitches
a spade, arriving at this position:
</p>
<diagram original="base">
<hand seat="N" sp="J" he="973" di="976" cl=""/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="6" he="" di="KQ85" cl="87"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="AKQ54" he="" di="42" cl=""/>
<hand seat="S" sp="T87" he="" di="JT3" cl="J"/>
</diagram>
<p>
North/South have promoted a natural trump trick, and West again needs to
get rid of his clubs, but can't attack spades.  Nor can he pull one round
of diamonds and ruff a club, because North can ruff ahead of him without
costing the natural trump trick.  There is, in fact, no way for West to
avoid losing two more tricks.
</p>
<h2>Clubs</h2>
<p>
If North/South declare clubs, the defense starts with three spades
(West pitching hearts) followed by three diamonds.  West is destined
to get a long trump, as well.  
</p><p>
If East/West declare clubs, the defense runs four clubs then three
hearts.  East is out of hearts, and West must follow, for seven tricks.
</p>
<h2>Post Mortem</h2>
<p>
This deal, perhaps, does not belong in this section - for example,
North/South don't have six top tricks against diamonds.  Still, the
basic pattern "take a bunch of top tricks then score your trumps by
promotion" is followed.  We're on a cusp of a more complex type of
Par Zero Deals.
</p><p>
The end position in the diamond contract is interesting.  Here is
a simpler version of it:
</p>
<diagram>
<hand seat="N" sp="J" he="T98" di="97" cl=""/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="6" he="2" di="Q85" cl="7"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="AK52" he="" di="A4" cl=""/>
<hand seat="S" sp="T83" he="" di="JT" cl="J"/>
</diagram>
<p>
North to lead, diamonds trumps, North/South need two tricks.  The only
lead to score two tricks is a heart lead.
