Fundamentally, this is about the timing for the unblock in clubs.
West's only entry to run his clubs is in spades.  East/West must
unblock the club ace before the spade king is taken.
</p><p>
If North/South are declaring, then, the defense immediately takes
the club ace, and then East leads a low spade.  If South ducks,
the defense has five clubs, a spade and the <heart card="A"/>.
But if South takes the trick, he is no better off.
</p><p>
If East/West are declaring, then South wins a diamond and immediately
leads a low spade to the queen.  If West wins, his hand is finished,
and declarer leads a spade to dummy's queen, leads a heart which
East must duck, and then takes all his winners, exiting with the
fourth spade.  East gets a long diamond, a spade, and the 
<club card="A"/>, but must eventually lead from the
<heart card="A"/>, giving South a second heart trick.  So West must
duck the spade, North wins the queen, and leads a heart.  If East
flies the ace, that sets up seven tricks for South (three diamonds,
two spades, and two hearts.)
</p><p>
So East must duck.  South takes the rest of his diamonds, then plays ace
and a spade, again killing West's entry before the clubs are unblocked.
