<h2>Notrump</h2>
<p>
    If East/West are on lead, they can set up two clubs, and have
    four diamonds, two clubs, and the <heart card="A"/>.
</p><p>
    If North/South are on lead, they can set up three hearts, and
    have three spades, three hearts, and a club.
</p>
<h2>Spades</h2>
<p>
    If East/West are on lead, they can take three top diamonds
    (West pitching a heart) and on the fourth diamond promotes a
    trump trick.  If South ruffs low, West overruffs and sets up
    a pair of club tricks. So South must ruff high, and West pitches
    a heart.  When West attacks hearts, West wins the second round
    and exits a high club to this position:
<diagram original="base">
<hand seat="N" sp="KQ64" he="" di="" cl="95"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="J75" he="" di="" cl="QJ3"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="T982" he="9" di="" cl="6"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="3" he="KJ" di="" cl="T87"/>
</diagram>
    Now if South tries to pitch a club loser from dummy
    on a heart, West ruffs high without costing the defense a trump
    trick.
</p><p>
    And declarer can't afford to draw two rounds of trumps before
    attacking hearts for the same reason. And if declarer plays
    two top spades and exits a spade, the defense gets to attack
    clubs before the heart ace is knocked out.
</p><p>
    The play of the fourth diamond is similar to the end position
    from <a href="ex8.html">Trump Magic.</a>  The lead functions
    as both a trump promotion and an entry killer.
</p><p>
    If North/South are on lead against spades, they draw three rounds
    of spades immediately and then set up hearts.  North/South have the
    club ace, three hearts, and three spades.  (If East ruffs the third
    heart winner, then North simply gets another trump.)
</p>
<h2>Hearts</h2>
<p>
    If North/South are on lead, they attack trumps immediately.
    When West wins and they take four top diamonds, South pitches
    a club.  North/South eventually get three hearts, three spades,
    and a club.
</p><p>
    If East/West are on lead, they take three diamonds (West pitching
    a spade) and then attack clubs.
</p>
<h2>Diamonds</h2>
<p>
    If East/West are on lead, they draw trumps, then lead clubs.
    They score two clubs, four diamonds and a heart.
</p><p>
    If North/South are on lead, the defense starts with three spades
    (South pitching a club) followed by the <heart card="Q"/> lead.
    This kills an entry to the West hand for setting up clubs two
    club tricks.  To preserve his other entry, the diamond queen,
    the defense cannot draw trumps.  West must win the second heart
    lead, and start with high clubs.  South wins the first one,
    and plays two rounds of high hearts, North pitching clubs.
    North/South have taken three spades, two hearts and a club, so
    East must ruff the fourth round of hearts, at which point North 
    must score a long trump.
</p>
<h2>Clubs</h2>
<p>
If North/South are on lead against clubs, they take three top spades, South
pitching a diamond.  At this point, North can lead anything and the contract
is set, but the direct route is hearts, starting the queen.  West wins the
second heart and the defense runs two diamonds getting to this position:
</p>
<diagram original="base">
<hand seat="N" sp="6" he="" di="98" cl="954"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="" he="76" di="" cl="KQJ3"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="T" he="9" di="KJ" cl="62"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="" he="JT" di="" cl="AT87"/>
</diagram>
<p>
Declarer has taken three spades, and one heart.  He has an obvious club
and additional heart, but he can also always score a second club with
a heart ruff high in dummy - East's weak doubleton can't overruff the
club nine.
</p><p>
If East/West are on defense, they start with four diamonds (West pitching
a spade on the third round.)  South can't pitch on the fourth diamond,
because the defense has two clubs and a heart absolutely, so South has
to ruff low, West pitching a second spade, leading to:
</p>
<diagram original="base">
<hand seat="N" sp="KQ64" he="Q8" di="" cl="954"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="J" he="A764" di="" cl="KQJ3"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="T982" he="952" di="" cl="62"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="A3" he="KJT3" di="" cl="AT8"/>
</diagram>
<p>
Nothing declarer does here can keep West from scoring three club tricks -
he cannot be endplayed, and if he ever ruffs a spade with the
<club card="3"/> it's all obvious.
