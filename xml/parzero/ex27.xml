<h2>Notrump</h2>

This is a fascinating deal with lots of blockages in various suits.
For example, for North/South, they have three spades and four hearts,
but the spade king queen have to be unblocked before the heart entry
is taken in order to take the seven tricks.  So if East/West declare
notrump, North takes the <spade cards=KQ"/>, then leads the
<heart card="4"/> to South, cash the <spade card="A"/> and overtake
the last heart with the ace, taking seven top tricks.
<p>
If North/South declare notrump, the defense appears to have five diamond
tricks and three clubs, but there is no way to unblock both suits.  The
best the defense can do, off the top, is five diamonds and one club.
After running the diamonds and the club ace, South exits
eight top tricks, but there is no way to untangle them to take more
than four off the top (East pitching two clubs and two spades) West exits
a heart, forcing North/South to take the hearts in the wrong order.

There is no way for North/South to untangle their major suits, so they
must concede either a heart or a club at the end.

<h2>Spades</h2>
If East/West declare spades, North/South start as against notrump,
cashing the spade king and queen, crossing to a heart, cashing the
spade ace, and then running three more hearts.  West can ruff the
last heart, but that just promotes South's trump nine.
