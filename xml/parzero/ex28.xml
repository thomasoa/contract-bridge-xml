<p>
This deal has complexity four, as described in the <link rel='internal' href="intro">Introduction.</link>
</p>
<h2>Notrump</h2>
<p>
North/South can set up two clubs, three hearts, and two spades.
East/West can set up three spades, one heart, three diamonds, and
a club.  The key, then, is timing.
</p>
<h3>North/South</h3>
<p>
If North/South declare notrump, the defense starts with a diamond to
East, followed by a spade lead (spades cannot be effectively
established by leading from West.)
</p>
<h3>East/West</h3>
<p>
If East/West declare notrump, the defense starts with a club.  The
best declarer can do is lead a spade to try to break up the
communication between the North/South hands.  South takes the 
<spade card="K"/>, and cashes the <club card="K"/>.
<diagram>
<hand seat="N" sp="A75" he="J972" di="3" cl="Q6^4"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="Q" he="K4" di="KT4" cl="JT98^7"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="J863" he="T865" di="AQ2" cl=""/>
<hand seat="S" sp="T" he="AQ3" di="J98765" cl="^K"/>
</diagram>
What does East pitch?  If East pitches a heart, then South can play
the <heart card="A"/> and then the <heart card="Q"/>, setting up two
hearts in dummy, along with the three tricks taken and the <club
card="Q"/> and <spade card="A"/> in dummy.
</p>
<p>If east pitches a low diamond, south plays the <heart card="A"/> and the
<heart card="Q"/>.  West wins, but what does West play?
</p>
<diagram>
<hand seat="N" sp="A75" he="J9" di="3" cl="Q6"/>
<hand seat="W" sp="Q" he="" di="KT4" cl="JT98"/>
<hand seat="E" sp="J863" he="T8" di="AQ" cl=""/>
<hand seat="S" sp="T" he="3" di="J98765" cl=""/>
</diagram>
<h2>Spades</h2>
<h3>North/South</h3>
<p>????</p>
<h3>East/West</h3>
<p>????</p>
<h2>Hearts</h2>
<h3>North/South</h3>
<p>????</p>
<h3>East/West</h3>
<p>????</p>
<h2>Diamonds</h2>
<h3>North/South</h3>
<p>
If North/South declare diamonds, the defense starts with the 
<club card="A"/>, then a heart shift.  Whatever declarer does,
he cannot avoid a heart loser, a club loser, and five seperate trump
losers in a cross-ruff.
</p>
<h3>East/West</h3>
<p>
If East/West declare diamonds, North/South start with diamonds,
keeping East/West from cross-ruffing diamonds.
</p>
<h2>Clubs</h2>
<h3>East/West</h3>
<p>
If East/West declare clubs, North/South start with diamonds.  The goal
is to score four trump tricks via ruffs, in addition to a heart
and two spades.  Say declarer wins in the East hand, and cashes the
<club card="A"/>.  Unfortunately for East/West, there is no entry to the West hand to continue clubs:
<diagram original="top">
<hand seat="N" sp="A754" he="J972" di="" cl="Q64"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="Q9" he="K4" di="T4" cl="JT987"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="J8632" he="T865" di="AQ" cl=""/>
<hand seat="S" sp="KT" he="AQ3" di="J9876" cl="K"/>
</diagram>
If a spade is led from dummy, South wins the king, gives North a diamond ruff,
a heart is returned to South's ace, and North ruffs another diamond.  North
cashes the spade ace and then leads a spade at this position: 
<diagram original="top">
<hand seat="N" sp="7^5" he="J97" di="" cl="Q"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="" he="K" di="" cl="JT987"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="J8^6" he="T86" di="" cl=""/>
<hand seat="S" sp="" he="Q3" di="J98" cl="^K"/>
</diagram>
South ruffs high, and West can either pitch his heart king or
underruff. In any event, the defense scores two spades, a heart, two
low diamond ruffs, a spade ruff high, and North's <club card="Q"/>.
</p>
<h3>North/South</h3>
<p>If North/South declare clubs, the defense starts with the <club card="A"/>,
then a heart.  Say South wins and leads a diamond, won by West.  South loses a trump to the king in South, and North can get one diamond ruff, but
declarer is held to two top trumps, a diamond ruff, two spades, and a heart.
</p>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>
What does <em>complexity four</em> mean? Essentially this means that none of the individual suits are parzero.  For example, if we take the spade suit:
<diagram>
<hand seat="N" sp="A754"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="Q9"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="J8632"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="KT"/>
</diagram>
and construct a symmetric deal from this distribution:
<diagram>
<hand seat="N" sp="A754" he="J8643" di="KT" cl="Q9"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="Q9" he="A754" di="J8643" cl="KT"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="J8632" he="KT" di="Q9" cl="A754"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="KT" he="Q9" di="A754" cl="J8643"/>
</diagram>
this resulting deal is <em>not</em> par-zero.
