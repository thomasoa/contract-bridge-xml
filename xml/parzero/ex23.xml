<h2>Notrump</h2>
<p>
If North/South declare notrump, the defense starts off with a low heart,
eventually getting four hearts, two spades, and either a club or a diamond.
South's immediate tricks are three top diamonds, a club, and the first
round heart.
</p>
<h2>Spades</h2>
<p>
If East/West declare spades, the defense starts with three top diamonds and
a diamond ruff (with the eight,) followed by the <club cards="AQ"/>,
North ruffing. North leads the last diamond at this position:

<hand seat="S" sp="J3" he="J" di="" cl="T943"/>
</diagram>
North/South have taken the first six tricks, with a natural trump trick
remaining, but the diamond lead brings the defense total to eight tricks.

If North/South declare spades, the defense starts off with three rounds
of spades.  South gets an entry too early.
