<h2>Notrump</h2>
<p>
If South is on lead, the defense starts with the <spade card="A"/> and
a spade. West wins the second or third round of spades, and cashes
the <heart card="K"/> and exits in diamonds, South winning the ace.
South then runs his spades reaching this position:
<diagram original="base">
<hand seat="N" sp="" he="Q7" di="T8" cl="KJ"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="" he="" di="KQ43" cl="T7"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="" he="AJ95" di="" cl="A9"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="" he="T8" di="975" cl="Q"/>
</diagram>
</p>
<p>
South has taken six tricks, so when he leads the <club card="Q"/>, 
East must win, but then has to concede a winner to North's hand.
</p><p>
So perhaps East/West should have killed South's club exit before leading
diamonds? East wins the club shift, cashes the <heart card="A"/> and then
leads the <diamond card="J"/>.
After South runs his spades, this end position is reached:
</p>
<diagram original="base">
<hand seat="N" sp="" he="" di="T8" cl="KJ"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="" he="" di="KQ4" cl="T"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="" he="J9" di="" cl="92"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="^2" he="" di="975" cl=""/>
</diagram>
<p>
West has to pitch on the last spade, but if he pitches a diamond, he has to give up a club trick to North at the end, and if he pitches the club, he has to give up a diamond trick to South.
</p><p>
If North/South declare notrump, the <heart card="K"/> is cashed, then a
diamond is led to the jack.
</p><p>If South ducks this, East cashes his <heart card="A"/> and leads
a high heart, setting up his heart suit before the <club card="A"/> entry
is taken.
</p><p> So South must win the diamond.  The problem is, that was South's only
entry to his spades, and North's hand is one trick shy to make up for it.
</p>
<h2>Spades</h2>
<p>If North/South declare spades, the defense gets two diamonds, a
diamond ruff, two hearts, a club and a spade.  The North hand is
made completely irrelevant.
