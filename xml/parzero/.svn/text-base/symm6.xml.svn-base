<p>
In most cases where either side has a fit, the opponents make up for
it by holding the top trumps.  In this case the trumps are not nearly
as weak. Despite the strength, the defense can always score three
trumps. 
</p><p>
Against spades, the defense starts by cashing the <heart cards="AK"/>,
then the <club cards="AK"/>, followed by a heart from West at: 
<diagram original="base">
<hand seat="S" sp="AK" he="Q" di="965432" cl=""/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="QJ8" he="965^4" di="T7" cl=""/>
<hand seat="N" sp="965432" he="" di="AK" cl="Q"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="T7" he="" di="QJ8" cl="9654"/>
</diagram>
</p>
<p>
If North ruffs, East overruffs and leads a club, which gives West
another trump trick.
</p>
<p>
If North pitches the <club card="Q"/>, East ruffs and still leads a
club: 
<diagram original="base">
<hand seat="S" sp="AK" he="" di="965432" cl=""/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="QJ8" he="965" di="T7" cl=""/>
<hand seat="N" sp="965432" he="" di="AK" cl=""/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="T" he="" di="QJ8" cl="965^4"/>
</diagram>
South can't ruff, or it promotes a third trump trick for the defense,
so South pitches a diamond and West ruffs <em>high.</em>  This is just
West's natural trump trick, but West then promotes another trump trick
in his hand by leading a fourth heart: 
<diagram original="base">
<hand seat="S" sp="AK" he="" di="96543" cl=""/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="J8" he="96^5" di="T7" cl=""/>
<hand seat="N" sp="965432" he="" di="K" cl=""/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="^T" he="" di="QJ8" cl="965"/>
</diagram>
East ruffs with the <spade card="T"/>, promoting a third trump trick
for the defense.
