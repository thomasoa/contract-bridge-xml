Srinivasa Damarla sent me this example with 9-card fits where nobody
makes. It's interesting to note that this is the ultimate case of
<em>wasted values;</em> every honor is held opposite a void.</p>
<p>
This is also a worse case for declarer than our first diagram - South can be
held to five tricks in notrump, clubs and diamonds.</p>
<p>
In spades, West starts with four clubs, East ruffing the fourth and
taking his diamonds. West still gets his long spade, holding South to
four tricks. 
</p>
<p>In hearts, West again starts with four clubs, and East pitches
spades. West then exits a heart. East still gets his four diamonds and
a long heart, again holding declarer to four tricks.  So in notrump,
having the lead is worth three tricks, while in each suit, having the
lead is worth four tricks.
