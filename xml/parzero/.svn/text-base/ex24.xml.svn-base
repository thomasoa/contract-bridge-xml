<p>A case with one hand holding a 7-card suit.</p>
<h2>Diamonds</h2>
<p>
If North/South declare diamonds, the defense starts off with the
<club card="A"/>,
the <heart card="A"/>, and two more top clubs, for four tricks.  East then
exits the <diamond card="K"/>, and West has three natural trump tricks.
</p><p>
If East/West declare diamonds, North starts with the <heart card="Q"/>,
destroying East's entry to the club winners.  North has two spade
tricks and four natural trump tricks.  If East ducks the heart,
that is North/South's seventh trick, while if East wins it, South
has a spade entry to two good hearts, and can pitch two of North's
club losers.</p>
<p>
This is purely a case where one side (East/West) needs to take its entries in
a particular order, and the other side can keep it from happening if
on lead.</p>
<h2>Clubs</h2>
<p>If North/South declare clubs, East/West start with the
<club card="A"/>, then the <heart card="A"/>, and two more
top clubs.  East then exits a heart to South, leading to:
<diagram original="base">
<hand seat="N" sp="K3" he="" di="AQ7643" cl=""/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="QJ65" he="8" di="JT985" cl=""/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="842" he="T9" di="K" cl="54"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="AT97" he="K75" di="" cl="J"/>
</diagram>
North/South get another heart, a club, a diamond, and two spades, for six
tricks total.</p>
<p>If East/West declare clubs, the defense starts with the spade king, the
diamond ace, the spade ace, and a spade ruff by North, then the heart
queen, again killing the heart entry before clubs are unblocked. 
Say East wins, and crosses to the club ace.
</p>
<diagram original="base">
<hand seat="N" sp="" he="" di="Q76432" cl="T"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="Q" he="86" di="JT98" cl=""/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="" he="T92" di="" cl="KQ54"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="T" he="KJ7" di="" cl="J98"/>
</diagram>
<p>
There is no way to prvent South from getting two hearts and a club, and,
in fact, North/South can make two club tricks via promotion.  Suppose
West exits in diamonds, North covering.  If East ruffs high, South has
two trump tricks.  If East ruffs low, South overruffs, takes his hearts,
then exits in spades or hearts, North ruffing with the ten, promoting a
second trick.  Similar promotions occur if West exits in spades or hearts.
</p>
<h2>Hearts</h2>
<p>
If East/West declare hearts, the defense starts with two top spades
and a spade ruff, then the <diamond card="A"/> and a diamond.
North/South have taken four tricks, and East/West can't prevent
them from scoring three trumps.
</p><p>
If North/South declare hearts, West takes his club ace, then the
<heart card="A"/>, two top clubs and a club ruff, leading to:
<diagram original="base">
<hand seat="N" sp="K3" he="" di="AQ7643" cl=""/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="QJ65" he="8" di="JT9" cl=""/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="842" he="T92" di="K" cl="5"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="AT97" he="KJ75" di="" cl=""/>
</diagram>
</p>
<p>East/West have the first five tricks, and have a sure heart trick.</p>
