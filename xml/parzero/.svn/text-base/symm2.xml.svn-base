<h2>Spades</h2>
Against spades (declared by South) West starts with <heart cards="AKQ"/>,
then a heart, ruffed by East.  East then cashes his <club cards="AKQ"/>, then
leads another club, West ruffing with the <spade card="T"/>, which promotes the
<spade card="J"/> in East's hand, giving the
defense eight tricks.
</p><h2>Hearts</h2><p>
Against hearts, West leads the <heart cards="AKQ"/> then exits
in hearts to North.  North can take three spades, but has to give
East an entry, and the defense gets five hearts and three clubs.
</p><h2>Diamonds</h2><p>
Against diamonds, West starts with two top hearts, then a heart ruff by East,
and three top clubs, followed by a club ruff and a fourth heart, ruffed
by East with the ten - essentially the same promotion as when defending the
spade contract.
</p><h2>Clubs</h2><p>
Against clubs, the defense takes three hearts, East pitching diamonds, then
a diamond ruff and three top clubs, ensuring East/West score five trumps
and three hearts.
</p><h2>Notrump</h2><p>
Against notrump, West starts with three top hearts, East pitching diamonds,
West then exits a heart to North, and both North and East have only
black suits.  East eventually gets three clubs and a spade, for a total
of six tricks.
