<p>
If South declares notrump, the defense starts with three top diamonds,
then three top clubs and a long diamond.
</p><p>
In spades, East/West start with three rounds of clubs, then three rounds
of diamonds, followed by a fourth club at this position:
<diagram original="base">
<hand seat="N" sp="AKQ" he="T987" di="" cl=""/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="654" he="J32" di="" cl="^7"/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="J32" he="654" di="7" cl=""/>
<hand seat="S" sp="T987" he="AKQ" di="" cl=""/>
</diagram>
The lead of the last club promotes East's <spade card="J"/>.</p>
<p>If East/West declare spades, North/South draw
trumps immediately, killing the promotion.</p>
<p>
All the other suits follow similarly.
</p>
<p>In fact, there are many deals of this sort above, where the defense 
takes the first six tricks and then sets up a seventh trick by a
trump promotion of some sort. These are common enough that I devote
the first set of non-symmetric deals to this idea.   It's very rare to have a
situation like the example in the introduction, with each side able to simply
take seven or more tricks off the top in every contract.
