<title>Another Candidate</title>

<diagram id="base">

<hand seat="W"  sp="65" he="7" di="8432" cl="AKQJT9"/>

</diagram>
<p>
If South declares notrump, hearts, or clubs, the defense can take twelve
tricks off the top.
</p>
<p>
If South declares spades, West starts with three top clubs, East pitching
a diamond on the second round.
</p><p>
If North ruffs the third round, East overruffs and plays two hearts,
West ruffing the second round, leading to:
<diagram original="base">
<hand seat="S" sp="AKQJT9" he="" di="7" cl="8"/>
<hand seat="W"  sp="6" he="" di="8432" cl="JT9"/>
<hand seat="N" sp="" he="84" di="AKQJT9" cl=""/>
<hand seat="E"  sp="432" he="QJT9" di="6" cl=""/>
</diagram>
With West on lead, he can cash a club, East pitching another diamond,
then give East a diamond ruff, for seven tricks.
</p>
<p>Obviously, the same defense works when South declares diamonds, only
in reverse.</p>
<p>So, is this a "worse" case than our previous candidate?  In the
previous candidate, we could not make more than five tricks in any suit,
and having the lead was worth five tricks against all suit contracts.
In this case, everybody can make six tricks in some suit, but having the
lead is worth an additional six tricks.</p>
