In this symmetric deal, nine tricks can be made in notrump by any declarer.
</p>
<p>
Given the symmetry of the deal, we only need to analyze one declarer, 
so we pick South as declarer just for consistency.
</p>
<p>
Fundamentally, the problem for the defense is that even though they
can set up either diamonds or clubs with one lead of the suit, both suits
are blocked, and there is no immediate entry to the hand that is set
up. </p>
<p> Isn't declarer similarly blocked?  Yes.  But look what happens to
the deal when West leads a low club.  North <em>pitches a spade</em>,
and South wins the trick in his hand, then leads a low spade to the ten,
East winning the jack, leading to:
<diagram original="start">
<hand seat="N" sp="Q" di="KJ" he="A8765432" cl=""/>
<hand seat="W" sp="" di="QT" he="KJ" cl="A876543"/>
<hand seat="E" sp="K" di="A8765432" he="" cl="T9"/>
<hand seat="S" sp="A876543" di="" he="QT9" cl="J"/>
</diagram>
East/West's clubs are blocked, and West at the moment has no entry.
What does East lead here?  When North/South get back in, they have
seven spades and the <heart card="A"/>, along with the <club card="K"/>
from the first trick.  But at this point the defense can only take two
clubs and the <diamond cards="A"/> before surrendering the lead.
</p>
<p>
But what if West led a diamond?  Then North covers, and, whatever East
does, South pitches a heart.  Now, South only needs to lose one
heart to take seven heart tricks, plus a diamond and a spade.
</p>
<p>
Finally, if West leads a heart, he lets East pitch a club to begin
an unblock, but he does nothing to set up any of his own suits.
Instead, he has blown his heart stop.  Declarer just wins three
hearts (the hearts are still blocked) and plays a low spade to the
ten, and East is forced to win, leading to this position:
<diagram original="start">
           <hand seat="N" sp="QT" di="KJ" he="87654" cl=""/>
           <hand seat="S" sp="A876543" di="" he="" cl="KJ"/>
</diagram>
Whatever East/West pitch on the three hearts and a spade, all they
can take when East gets in is their diamond and club aces, and then when
declarer gets back in, he takes the ace and queen of spade and five
hearts, along with the first three hearts [if the
defense takes the <club card="A"/>, North must pitch a heart, but then
South's <club card="K"/> becomes good.] 
</p>
<h2>What is happening here?</h2>
<p>Each side has two suits they might try
to set up.  In order to set up and run a suit, they need to lose a trick in the suit, and then either pitch a card from the <holding cards="QT9"/> holding to unblock the suit, or lose the lead again to set up an entry to the long
suit to make up for the blockage.
</p>
<p>Now, when West leads a club, he does the first step - losing the
mandatory club trick.  But the club also lets North pitch a spade, so
both sides take a step towards their respective goals.  When North leads
a spade to lose to East, West gets to pitch, but he holds the <holding
cards="QT9"/> in <em>diamonds.</em>  If he pitches a diamond, East/West 
have taken one step towards establishing diamonds and one step towards
establishing clubs, while North/South have taken the two steps needed
to establish spades. 
</p>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>I have been informed that this deal was previously discovered by
John Beasley, and reported in "The Games and Puzzles Journal" in 1988.
</p>
<p>I have computed
double-dummy results for all 16,777,216 different symmetric deals.
"representatives." 
Of these deals, this is the only one where each side can make nine
tricks in notrump.  In fact, it is the only one that can make more
than seven tricks in notrump.  Is this deal unique?  I can't claim
that at this moment, but I would not be surprised if it was.  It is
certainly unique amongst symmetric deals.
</p>
<p>
There are known cases where both <em>sides</em> can make 13 tricks in 
notrump.  For a simple example:
<diagram>
           <hand seat="N" sp="AKQJT98" he="AKQJT9" di="" cl=""/>
<hand seat="W" sp="" he="" di="AKQJT98" cl="AKQJT9"/>
                            <hand seat="E" sp="765432" he="8765432" di="" cl=""/>
           <hand seat="S" sp="" he="" di="765432" cl="8765432"/>
</diagram>
Here, <contract code="7N"/> makes when declared by North and East.
</p>
<p>Richard Pavlicek reports a 
<link external="http://www.rpbridge.net/7a59.htm#10">deal where
both sides can make 9 tricks in the same suit,</link> and it is the last
making contract for both sides:
<diagram>
           <hand seat="N" sp="9" he="JT9" di="AQ432" cl="AKQ2"/>
<hand seat="W" sp="" he="" di="JT98765" cl="876543"/>
                           <hand seat="E" sp="AKQ8" he="AKQ87" di="K" cl="JT9"/>
           <hand seat="S" sp="JT765432" he="65432" di="" cl=""/>
</diagram>
Both East and South can make <contract code="3S"/>, and no higher contract
makes.
